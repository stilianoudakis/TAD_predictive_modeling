@article{Schmitt:2016aa,
	Abstract = {The three-dimensional configuration of DNA is integral to all nuclear processes in eukaryotes, yet our knowledge of the chromosome architecture is still limited. Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture studies have uncovered features of chromatin organization in cultured cells, but genome architecture in human tissues has yet to be explored. Here, we report the most comprehensive survey to date of chromatin organization in human tissues. Through integrative analysis of chromatin contact maps in 21 primary human tissues and cell types, we find topologically associating domains highly conserved in different tissues. We also discover genomic regions that exhibit unusually high levels of local chromatin interactions. These frequently interacting regions (FIREs) are enriched for super-enhancers and are near tissue-specifically expressed genes. They display strong tissue-specificity in local chromatin interactions. Additionally, FIRE formation is partially dependent on CTCF and the Cohesin complex. We further show that FIREs can help annotate the function of non-coding sequence variants.},

@article{Tyner:2017aa,
	Abstract = {Since its 2001 debut, the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) team has provided continuous support to the international genomics and biomedical communities through a web-based, open source platform designed for the fast, scalable display of sequence alignments and annotations landscaped against a vast collection of quality reference genome assemblies. The browser's publicly accessible databases are the backbone of a rich, integrated bioinformatics tool suite that includes a graphical interface for data queries and downloads, alignment programs, command-line utilities and more. This year's highlights include newly designed home and gateway pages; a new 'multi-region' track display configuration for exon-only, gene-only and custom regions visualization; new genome browsers for three species (brown kiwi, crab-eating macaque and Malayan flying lemur); eight updated genome assemblies; extended support for new data types such as CRAM, RNA-seq expression data and long-range chromatin interaction pairs; and the unveiling of a new supported mirror site in Japan.},

@article{Orriols-Puig2008,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the capabilities of evolutionary on-line rule-based systems, also called learning classifier systems (LCSs), for extracting knowledge from imbalanced data. While some learners may suffer from class imbalances and instances sparsely distributed around the feature space, we show that LCSs are flexible methods that can be adapted to detect such cases and find suitable models. Results on artificial data sets specifically designed for testing the capabilities of LCSs in imbalanced data show that LCSs are able to extract knowledge from highly imbalanced domains. When LCSs are used with real-world problems, they demonstrate to be one of the most robust methods compared with instance-based learners, decision trees, and support vector machines. Moreover, all the learners benefit from re-sampling techniques. Although there is not a re-sampling technique that performs best in all data sets and for all learners, those based in over-sampling seem to perform better on average. The paper adapts and analyzes LCSs for challenging imbalanced data sets and establishes the bases for further studying the combination of re-sampling technique and learner best suited to a specific kind of problem.},
