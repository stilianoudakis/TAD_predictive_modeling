# ABSTRACT (Spiro version)

**Background.** Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) represent fundamental building blocks that lead to the organization and regulation of the three-dimensional (3D) genome. The enrichment of several epigenetic marks at TAD boundaries suggests a strong epigenetic component of TAD boundary formation. Several methods have been developed to leverage the growing amount of (epi)genomic annotation data for predicting TAD boundaries; however, they overlooked key characteristics of the data including spatial associations between genomic annotations and boundaries, as well as the severe imbalance in TAD-boundary vs non-TAD boundary defined genomic regions. Furthermore, resolution of Hi-C data remains well below the resolution of epigenomic assays (hundredths of bases for ChIP-seq) affecting the ability of Hi-C sequencing in discerning gene-level features of chromatin. This resolution gap between 1D and 3D genomic maps, as well as a paucity of chromatin features below the level of TADs, has significantly limited our understanding of epigenomic regulation of gene expression and its potential link to chromatin architecture.

**Methods.** We first developed an ensemble framework for optimizing data level characteristics necessary for TAD boundary prediction including combinations of 5 Hi-C data resolutions (5 kb to 100 kb), 3 spatially defined predictor types, and 4 re-sampling techniques, across the GM12878 and K562 cell lines. We then aimed to predict TAD boundary location on a 1D genomic map by validating optimally built cell line specific models at basepair resolution. 

**Results.** We demonstrate with our ensemble framework that cell line specific random forest classifiers built on 10 kb resolution Hi-C data, with distance-type predictors, using SMOTE (*Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique*) re-sampling yield optimal predictive performances, and outperform existing methods. Cell specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were the best type of genomic annotations for predicting TAD boundaries when directly compared with histone modifications and chromatin states; we identified the well-known CTCF, SMC3, RAD21, and ZNF143 TFBS known to be enriched at TAD boundaries. Additionally, TAD boundary regions predicted at basepair resolution using our optimally built cell line specific models were found to be significantly closer to known enriched epigenomic marks indicating more accurate identification of TAD boundaries than existing Hi-C sequencing technologies.

**Conclusions.** Our results outline strategies for predictive modeling of 3D genomic domains using 1D genome annotation data. The accurate modeling of TAD boundaries will improve our understanding of how epigenetics shapes the 3D structure of the genome.


# ABSTRACT (MD version)

**Background.** Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) represent fundamental building blocks of the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and regulation. Several epigenetic marks, such as CTCF, are highly enriched at TAD boundaries, suggesting a strong epigenetic component of TAD boundary formation. Several methods have been developed to leverage the growing amount of (epi)genomic annotation data for predicting TAD boundaries; however, they overlooked key characteristics of the data, such as spatial associations between a genomic annotation and a boundary. Furthermore, the number of regions containing TAD boundaries is much smaller than the rest of the genome, creating a class imbalance problem. 

**Methods.** To investigate the problem of spatial genomic relationships and class imbalance, we developed an ensemble framework for optimizing prediction of TAD boundaries. We utilized several resampling techniques (random over- and undersampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE)) coupled with various metrics for classifier performance evaluation (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) curve, Precision-Recall curve (AUPRC), F1, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), among others) to select the best predictive model in class imbalance settings.

**Results.** Using different feature engineering and resampling strategies, coupled with elastic net-based feature selection, we systematically compared the performance of models predicting the location of TAD boundaries (Gm12878 and K562 Hi-C data at 10kb to 100kb resolutions). Precision-Recall curves were found to be best suited for evaluating model performance in class imbalance settings. Random undersampling and SMOTE-resampled data performed best for optimal parameter selection. Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) were the best type of genomic annotations for predicting TAD boundaries when directly compared with histone modifications and chromatin states; we identified well-known CTCF, SMC3, RAD21, and several novel TFBSs as best predictors of TAD boundaries. Importantly, spatial relationships (distance between TAD boundaries and genomic annotations) were best predictors of TAD boundaries as compared with commonly used overlap counts or percent overlap measures.

**Conclusions.** Our results outline strategies for predictive modeling of 3D genomic domains using 1D genome annotation data. The accurate modeling of TAD boundaries will improve our understanding of how epigenetics shapes the 3D structure of the genome.

# INTRODUCTION

The advent of various genome-wide sequencing technologies, such as high-throughput conformation capture (notably Hi-C), have revealed the spatial organization of the human genome  [@lieberman2009comprehensive]. Analyses have shown that the genome is folded into distinct compartments termed topologically associating domains (TADs) [@dixon2012topological]. Given their high degree of conservation between cell types and species, it has been proposed that TADs represent the fundamental building blocks of organization, giving the genome its 3D structure [@rocha2015breaking]. Studies have shown that changing the 3D structure of the DNA, causing disruptions in these domains, can lead to adverse outcomes and diseases like cancer [@hnisz2016activation; @Flavahan2016; @song2017ctcf]. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to be able to identify the key molecular drivers of the formation of TAD boundaries in order to further our understanding of the human genome. It has been thought that the collection of particular functional genomic elements may contribute to the formation of TADs. Namely, the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been shown to be enriched at TAD boundaries [@ghirlando2016ctcf]. Additional transcription factors including SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21 have also been shown to colocalize near TAD boundaries [@sanborn2015chromatin; @fudenberg2016formation; @alipour2012self]. Likewise, chromatin has been shown to exhibit certain modifications at TAD boundaries, evidenced by the frequent observation of the H3K36me3 histone mark [@dixon2012topological]. However, the growing number of publically available annotated genomic elements and there collinearity pose a significant problem for establishing methods robust enough to determine the most important epigenomic factors that contribute to TAD boudandary formation. Moreover, the plasticity of functional annotations make TAD boundary prediction a cell line specific problem [@wang2012widespread]

## PROBLEMS AND LIMITATIONS

The distinct patterns in epigenomic marks, binding peaks of different factors, and actively transcribed genes prompt the use of computational approaches toward TAD boundary prediction  <!--[@dixon2015chromatin; @di2017novo]-->. Currently, classification models have been used to draw associations between these functional annotations and genomic regions that include TAD boundaries. However, many key characteristics of 3D genomic data remain unexplored, potentially limiting the performance of predictive modeling. 

First, the use of different levels of association between TAD boundary regions and genomic features as predictors remain underexplored. These associations are termed predictor-types and make up the feature space of classifiers. Counts of overlaps (**overlap count**, OC) is the most commonly used type of association as it simply counts the total number of peaks defining a genomic annotation that are inside a given TAD boundary region. Percents of overlaps (**overlap percent**, OP) represents a more precise measure of association as it considers the proportion of overlap between a genomic annotation and a boundary region. However, the distance between boundary regions and genomic annotations are currently unexplored. This association allows for quantifying the spatial relationship between genomic elements and boundary regions. We hypothesize that the inclusion of this type of association will correspond with more accurate identification of functional genomic elements association with TAD boundary formation.

Secondly, the minority of TAD boundaries as compared with the rest of the genome creates proportionally small TAD boundary regions versus non-TAD boundary regions. These boundary regions make up the minority class, while the non-boundary regions make up the remaining majority class. The large disparity is sizes between minority and majority classes creates imbalanced data, as can be characterized by the *class imbalance* (CI). Here, CI is defined as the ratio of the set minority class observations to the sum of both sets of minority and majority class observations. That is, CI is bounded by 0 and 0.50. A dataset is considered balanced if CI $\approx$ 0.50, and imbalanced as CI approaches 0. Classifiers implemented on heavily imbalanced datasets are known to exhibit poor performances as the learned model is biased towards the majority class [@lusa2010class; @chen2013influence; @jeni2013facing]. We hypothesize that the implementation of novel data resampling techniques will significantly improve model performance. Futhermore, the choice of performance metric can mask the poor performance of models implemented on imbalanced data.  It has been shown that conventional metrics such as AUC and accuracy are insensitive to class imbalance, creating artificially inflated values influenced by the majority class [@prati2011survey; @wei2013role]. Therefore, we hypothesize that a more composite metric such as Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), might provide more sensitive assessment of model performance, given that it penalizes for both false positives and false negatives.

Thirdly, TAD boundary location is known to be heavily influenced by the resolution of the subsequent Hi-C interaction matrix [@sexton2012three]. Higher resolutions require a larger number of mapped reads, thereby creating larger data matrices, increasing computation time. However, the increased resolution available in newer datasets has highlighted the existence of a hierarchical structure of TADs inside other TADs [@pal2019hi]. It is unclear how varying levels of resolution affect the association between functional genomic annotations and TAD boundary regions.

<!--[Paragraph about disconnect between Hi-C and epigenomic data] 
Despite the success of Hi-C technologies in revealing the high-order levels of genome organization (chromosome territories, A/B compartments, TADs, sub-TADs, chromatin loops), resolution of Hi-C data (~750kb [??? REF, Bonev 2017?]) remains well below resolution of epigenomic assays (hundredths of bases for ChIP-seq). One of the key missing pieces to connect 3D genome architecture to transcription has been the inability of Hi-C to attain the resolution necessary to discern gene-level features of chromatin. This resolution gap between 1D and 3D genomic maps, as well as a paucity of chromatin features below the level of TADs, has significantly limited our understanding of epigenomic regulation of gene expression and its potential link to chromatin architecture. Although computational [??? REFS?](Zhang et al., “HiCPlus.”, Carron et al., “Boost-HiC.”) and technological [@Hsieh:2019aa][@Ma:1998aa][@Belaghzal2017] methods for enhancing resolution of Hi-C data started to appear, they [??? remains to write about their pitfalls]. One aim of this study is to predict the location of TAD boundaries on a scale comparable to epigenomic assays. For this, we developed a model trained on a relatively coarse Hi-C data for predicting 3D features (TAD boundaries) from 1D data (epigenomic datasets).-->


## PREVIOUS METHODS

<!--[still revising]-->
Recently, an L1-regularized multiple logistic regression model, called *HiCfeat*, was developed to predict TAD boundary regions using a collection of 69 transcription factor binding sites on the GM12878 cell line [@mourad2016computational]. 

Another method used an L2-based regularized linear model to discriminate between what was termed as "boundary-" and "TAD-segments" of the hESC cell line [@hong2017computational].

A method devolped in 2015 used a tree based model to predict TAD boundary regions using 9 different cell line specific histone modifications, as well as consensus CTCF peaks, across 8 cell lines [@huang2015predicting]. 

## OUR APPROACH

In this study, we have developed a computational framework aimed at determining the optimal set of data level characteristics necessary for optimal prediction of TAD boundaries and identification of influential genomic annotations. These include the best combination of predictor type, resampling technique, and data resolution. We utilize random forest classification models built on Hi-C data from two cell lines, including GM12878 and K562, obtained at four different resolutions, including 5 kb 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb. For each cell line and resolution, we compared three predictor types, including counts, percents, and distances. Additionally, we compared three re-sampling techniques, including random under-sampling, random over-sampling, and a weighted combination of both referred to as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Model performances were evaluated and compared using Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). We performed 10-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning and to guard against over-fitting. We found that the optimally built cell line specific model is one implemented using distance type predictors, with SMOTE resampling, at the 10-kb data resolution. We also determined that simply including transcription factor binding sites was necessary for optimal performance. The inclusion of chromatin states and histone modifications was found to induce noise into the model. Specifically, we found that the transcription factors CTCF, ZNF143, RAD21, and SMC3 exhibited high predictive importances, confirming there involvement in TAD boundary formation. We then aimed to evaluate the cell line specificity of TAD boundaries by validating our optimally built models across cell lines. We found that models built and validated on the same cell line outperformed models that were validated across cell lines, confirming the cell line specific nature and plasticity of TAD boundaries and functional genomic annotations respectively. <!--[add conclusion from results of predicting finer bins]-->

# METHODS

## DOMAIN DATA

Biological replicate Hi-C data were downloaded from GEO GSE63525 [@rao20143d] (Supplementary Table 1) for the GM12878 and K562 cell lines. The autosomal genomic coordinates (GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly) of TAD boundaries were obtained from data at 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb resolution using the Arrowhead algorithm [@durand2016juicebox]. TAD boundaries called on chromosome 9 were omitted from all downstream analyses, for all resolutions and cell lines, due to the sparsity of the contact matrix at the 10 kb resolution for the K562 cell line.

## GENOMIC ANNOTATION DATA

Genomic annotation data in the form of cell type specific chromatin states (ChromHMM), histone modifications (HM), and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser Database (GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly) [@Tyner:2017aa] (Supplementary Table 2). Each functional annotation was represented by chromosome-specific coordinates on the linear genome obtained by ChIP-seq peak calling algorithms.

## DEVELOPING FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL DATA LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS FOR TAD BOUNDARY PREDICTION

### CLASSIFICATION

To establish the data for classification, the genome was binned into equally sized intervals defined by the data resolution of the corresponding contact matrix. As an example, for domain data obtained from a 100 kb resolution contact matrix, the genome was binned into 100 kb intervals. In order to accommodate for the uncertainty in exact boundary location, the boundary points were flanked on both sides by the size of the resolution of the corresponding contact matrix. That is, for 100 kb resolution data, each uniquely identified TAD boundary was flanked on either side by 100 kb for a total width around each boundary point of 200,000 base pairs. A genomic bin was defined as a TAD boundary region ($Y = 1$) if it overlapped with at least one flanked TAD boundary. Otherwise, the bin was considered a non-TAD boundary region ($Y = 0$). Random forest classifiers were used to discriminate between TAD and non-TAD boundary regions on chromosome-specific sections of the linear genome.

### FEATURE ENGINEERING 

Cell line specific genomic annotations were used to built the feature space of our random forest models. Here, we created three types of predictors that were used to describe the relationship between functional annotations and genomic bins. They are described in detail below:

1. **Overlap Count (OC)**: For each genomic bin, the total number of instances where a bin overlapped with regions assigned to genomic annotations (features). 
   
2. **Overlap Percent (OP)**: For each genomic bin, the percent of overlap between the bin and the region assigned to a genomic annotation, defined as the *feature width*. If multiple overlaps existed, the *feature width* was defined as the sum of the total number of bases that overlapped with a particular bin. 

3. **Log2 Distance**: For each genomic bin, the $log_{2}$ of the distance in bases (refered to hereafter as *Distance*), from the center of the bin to the center of the nearest region defined by a specific genomic annotation. 

### TRAINING AND TESTING

The data set used for modeling was composed of two components: the response vector **Y**, an indicator variable separating between TAD and non-TAD boundary regions, and the predictor-type specific data matrix, **X** = {$X_1$, $X_2$, ..., $X_p$}, where $p$ was the complete set of functional annotations. Each composed data set was specific to cell line, resolution, and chromosome. We then split the data into a 7:3 ratio of training to testing sets. <!--For the task of performance evaluation and prediction, the test set remained untouched to account for an unbiased comparison between data level characteristics.-->

### DATA RE-SAMPLING

Class imbalance was (CI) defined as the ratio of minority class observations to the sum of minority and majority class observations:

$$CI = \dfrac{C_{min}}{C_{min} + C_{maj}}$$

where $C_{min}$ denotes the set of TAD boundary regions and $C_{maj}$ denotes the complementary set non-TAD boundary regions. Here, CI is bounded by 0 and 0.50. Heavily imbalanced classes tend to approach 0, while balanced classes approach 0.50.

In order to assess the influence of imbalanced classes, we evaluated four re-sampling techniques (including to no re-sampling). They are described in detail below.

1. **No Sampling**: All of the data points from the majority and minority classes of the training set were used.

2. **Random Under-Sampling (RUS)**: All of the data points from the minority class of the training set were used. Sampling without replacement was used to obtain the same number of data points from the majority class. 

3. **Random Over-Sampling (ROS)**: All of the data points from the majority class of the training set were used. Sampling with replacement was used to obtain the same number of data points from the minority class. 

4. **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique): This method incorporates both random under- and over-sampling [@chawla2002smote]. Under-sampling is performed without replacement from the majority class. Over-sampling is performed by creating new synthetic observations using the minority class. The minority class is over-sampled by taking each minority class sample and introducing synthetic examples along the feature vectors joining any/all of the k=5 (default) minority class nearest neighbors. The SMOTE algorithm can have many variations in the weightinh of over- and under-sampling. In this study we restricted the algorithm to 100% over-sampling and 200% under-sampling. That is, 1 new synthetic observation was to be created for each existing minority class data point, while 2 data points were simultaneously randomly selected from the majority class. This combination results in perfectly balanced classes. The *DMwR* R package was used to perform SMOTE (version 0.4.1). 

### FINAL MODEL ASSESSMENT AND PERFORMANCE

Random forest classification models were built to compare model performances between combinations of data resolutions, predictor types, and re-sampling techniques. To reduce bias due to random dataset generation, 10-fold cross validation was used to tune the number of annotations, *p*, to consider at each node. The number of trees that were aggregated for each random forest model was set to the default, n=500. All random forest algorithms were implemented in R using the *caret* package version 6.0 [@kuhn2012caret]. The performance of each model was compared using Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), defined as <!--The MCC is, in essence, the correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted binary classifications [@brodersen2010balanced]. A value of 1 represents a perfect prediction, while a value of -1 represents total disagreement between prediction and observation. A value of 0 indicates no better than random prediction. The MCC is defined as-->

<!--
$$F1 - Score = \frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}$$
-->

$$
MCC = \frac{TP \times TN - FP \times FN}{\sqrt{ (TP + FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN) }}
$$
<!--
$$Balanced \quad Accuracy = \dfrac{1}{2}\left( \dfrac{TP}{TP+FN} + \dfrac{TN}{TN+FP} \right)$$
-->

<!--
$$Informedness = \dfrac{TP}{TP+FN} + \dfrac{TN}{TN+FP} - 1$$
-->

where TP refers to the number of bins correctly identified as containing a TAD boundary (true positives), FP refers to the number of bins incorrectly identified as containing a TAD boundary (false positives), TN refers to the number of bins correctly identified as not containing a TAD boundary (true negatives), and FN refers to the number of bins incorrectly identified as not containing a TAD boundary (false negatives). Each of these quantities are obtained from the confusion matrix created by validating the model on the testing set. <!--Additional performance metrics including AUROC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were [??? are?] reported in the supplementary materials. [??? Where is it?]-->

### FEATURE REDUCTION

Many genomic annotations, notably architectural proteins, tend to exhibit an extensive pattern of colocalization (correlation) [@van2014insulator]. This can contribute to high collinearity which can result in overfitting a predictive model. To measure the pairwise correlation of each cell line specific annotation, we used the Jaccard Index. The Jaccard Index measures the ratio of the number of intersecting base pairs between two sets to the number of base pairs in the union, subtracted by the intersection [@favorov2012exploring]. The quantity ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents no overlap (no correlation) and 1.0 represent complete overlap (complete correlation). 

In order to suitably reduce the feature space and prevent overfitting, we implemented recursive feature elimination to estimate the optimal number of necessary features to include in the model. The best performing subset was identified, ranging from 2 to the maximum number of features by powers of 2. Given that our approach is chromosome specific, we aggregated the predictive importance of the union of the optimal set of features across chromosome using the mean decrease in node impurity. We then performed hierarchical clustering to obtained the most common and top ranked annotations responsible for TAD boundary prediction.

## USING OPTIMALLY BUILT RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIERS FOR MORE PRECISE TAD BOUNDARY PREDICTION

Once we established our optimally built and feature reduced random forest classifier, we aimed to leverage the enrichment of known annotations to predict TAD boundaries at base pair resolution. We established a *predicted TAD boundary region* as a collection of adjacent base pairs that were given a probability of 1 by our model in being a predicted TAD boundary. To guard against inflating the number of predicted TAD boundaries, we clustered the distances between the midpoints of the *predicted TAD boundary region*. We then performed partitioning around mediods (PAM) to determine the *predicted TAD boundary region* that was most representative of the cluster. Lastly, the midpoint, in this case a particular basepair, of the *predicted TAD boundary region* identified as the medoid was defined as a *predicted TAD boundary*. 

# RESULTS

## A RESOLUTION-SPECIFIC APPROACH FOR PREDICTING TAD BOUNDARIES

We analyzed publically available replicate Hi-C data sets from the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). Topologically associating domains (TADs) were subsequently called using the ARROWHEAD pipeline [@durand2016juicer] at five data resolutions: 5 kb 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb. After removing TADs that exceeded 2 md in length (biologically plausible maximum TAD size [@dixon2012topological; @sofueva2013cohesin] [??? Add ref, see one in SpectralTAD; !!!added]), we obtained a total of 16133, 14824, 8081, 3560, and 919 unique TAD boundaries for the GM12878 cell line, and 9314, 10881, 6923, 3197, and 831 unique TAD boundaries for the K562 cell line across each of the five resolutions respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). To account for the variability in boundary location due to varying resolution, we developed a resolution-specific approach toward constructing TAD versus non-TAD boundary regions on the linear genome (See Methods), labeled as a response vector **Y** (Figure 1A). TAD boundary regions were defined as regions on the linear genome where a genomic bin overlapped with a flanked TAD boundary ($Y = 1$), while non-TAD boundary regions were defined as the regions that did not overlap with a flanked TAD boundary ($Y = 0$). On average, we found that only 18.0% (SD=4.6%) [??? Need to put exactly, e.g., $18.34 \pm 5.06 \%$; !!!added] of TAD boundary regions overlapped between both cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2). Given the cell type specificity of TAD boundaries, we opted to build cell line specific models for predicting TAD boundary regions. The results presented are for the GM12878 cell line, with K562 results presented in the Supplementary material. In summary, we developed a framework enabling resolution-specific prediction of TAD boundaries, with resolution-specific bins defining the response variable.

![**Illustrating the resolution-specific data construction and feature engineering used for downstream modeling.** (A) Unique boundaries are denoted by the blue dots. The yellow regions denote the flanked boundary regions according to the Hi-C data resolution (i.e., 100 kb resolution corresponded to a 100 kb flank for a total boundary region of 200 kb). The linear genome was subsequently binned into resolution-specific intervals. The response vector **Y** was defined as a genomic bin that either overlapped with a flanked TAD boundary ($Y = 1$) or did not ($Y = 0$). (B) Three types of associations between bins and genomic annotations (green shapes) used to build the feature space include _Overlap Counts_ (OC), _Overlap Percent_ (OP), and ($log_{2}$) _Distance_. ](Figures/model_construction_and_predictor_types.png)

## THREE TYPES OF PREDICTORS DEFINE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN TAD BOUNDARY REGIONS AND GENOMIC ANNOTATIONS

A total of 78 cell type specific functional genomic annotations for the GM12878 and K562 cell line were used to build the feature space of downstream predictive models (Supplementary Table 2). The annotations could be broken down into three sets including histone modifications (HM), chromatin state segmentations (ChromHMM), and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We constructed three different predictor types for each functional genomic annotation (Figure 1B). Counts of overlaps (**overlap count**, OC) were defined as the total number of genomic annotation regions that overlapped within a given genomic bin. Percents of overlaps (**overlap percent**, OP) were defined as the proportion of a bin overlapped by an annotation region. **Distance** was defined as log2 transformed number of base pairs between between the centers of bins and regions defining genomic annotations. A log2-transformation of distance was used to account for the skewness present in the distributions of distances (Supplementary Figure 4). These feature engineering steps were performed to improve TAD boundary predictions by accounting for direct (OC), proportional (OP), and indirect (distance) relationships between TAD boundaries and genomic annotations.

## TAD VS. NON-TAD BOUNDARY CLASS IMBALANCE IS SEVERE IRRESPECTIVELY OF Hi-C DATA RESOLUTION 

Given that the number of bins annotated as TAD boundaries (TAD boundary regions) is much smaller than the number of non-TAD boundary bins, we investigated the class imbalance (CI) [??? I changed PI to CI - change in supplementary accordingly; !!!fixed] featured at each resolution. The CI was defined as the ratio of TAD boundary regions ($Y=1$) versus the sum of both TAD and non-TAD boundary regions and ranging from 0 to 0.50. The CI was found to be invariant to resolution, remaining consistently low across chromosomes, with an average of 0.196 (SD=0.025) and 0.166 (SD=0.026) for the GM12878 and K562 cell lines, respectively [??? Add exact numbers, like $18.34 \pm 5.06 \%$ !!!added] (Supplementary Figure 3). To account for such imbalance we evaluated 4 re-sampling techniques (in addition to no re-sampling) before predicting TAD boundaries. **Random over-sampling** (ROS) was defined as sampling with replacement from TAD boundary regions. **Random under-sampling** (RUS) was defined as sampling with replacement from non-TAD boundary regions. Lastly, we considered **Synthetic minority over-sampling technique** (SMOTE), which is a combination of both random over- and under-sampling [@chawla2002smote].

[??? Very briefly introduce each technique, refer to Methods for details; !!!added]

## ENSEMBLE FRAMEWORK FOR TAD BOUNDARY PREDICTION

To identify the combination of data resolution, predictor type, and re-sampling technique necessary for optimal cell line specific TAD boundary prediction, we created an ensemble framework to systematically compare performances of different model inputs (Figure 2). The framework uses data for a particular cell line *L = {GM12878, K562}*, at a given resolution *R = {5 kb, 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, 100 kb}*, using one of the predictor type *P = {OC, OP, Distance}*, and the re-sampling technique *B = {None, RUS, ROS, SMOTE}*. Once the model inputs were established, a random forest classifier was trained on chromosome-specific datasets using 10-fold cross validation. The different combinations of inputs were evaluated by assessing the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of each model [??? Ugly sentence, rewrite; !!!fixed]. Letting $|X|$ denote the cardinality of each set, we evaluated $|L| \times |R| \times |P| \times |B|$ different ensemble systems, totaling $2 \times 5 \times 3 \times 4 \times 21 = 2520$) models. Additional performance metrics are reported in the Supplementary materials.

![**A diagram of the ensemble framework detailing the combination of inputs used in the model building pipeline.** Each cell line (GM12878, K562) specific model was composed of a combination of different data level characteristics including resolution (5 kb, 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, 100 kb), predictor type (overlap count (OC), overlap percent (OP), $log_{2}$ distance (Distance)), and re-sampling technique (no re-sampling (None), random over-sampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)). The following sets of genomic annotations were used to create each predictor type including histone modification (HM), chromating state segmentations (ChromHMM), transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). [??? Describe abbreviations on the figure, the figure itself is already described in text;!!!fixed] ](Figures/figure3_ensemble_framework_V3.png)

## SMOTE RESAMPLING, DISTANCE-BASED ASSOCIATIONS OF TAD BOUNDARIES AND GENOMIC ANNOTATIONS, AND 10KB RESOLUTION OF HI-C DATA PROVIDED OPTIMAL MODEL PERFORMANCE [??? This paragraph was completely rewritten, check for logic flow; !!!fixed]

We investigated the effect of class imbalance on model performance using three re-sampling techniques. Expectedly, when using data as-is, that is, with class imbalance present, the models performed poorly. Using any of the resampling techniques improved the performance, with SMOTE-resampled data being the most optimal (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 3). These results suggest that a combination of both random over- and under-sampling (SMOTE) can improve TAD boundary prediction.

We found that, regardless of resampling technique, random forest classifiers built using a distance-type feature space yielded consistently higher MCCs when compared to the overlap count and overlap percent predictor types (Figure 3), and these results were consistent across resolutions and cell types (Supplementary Figure 5). This indicated that models are better able to discriminate between TAD and non-TAD boundary regions when provided with spatially related associations.

Interestingly, we found that performances peaked at 10 kb resolution and then degraded as data resolution decreased. The reason for the improved performance between 5 kb and 10 kb data resolutions can be due to the sparsity in the interaction frequency matrices at finer resolutions. [??? Quantify sparsity, need to substantiate this statement] This sparsity may lead to inaccurate TAD calling and, subsequently, to worse model performance. These results suggest that finer resolution of Hi-C data is not always optimal for accurate TAD calling and prediction, and sparsity of the data needs to be considered. Additionally, performances tended to be much more variable between chromosomes at lower resolutions, evidenced by the wider error bars for the 50 kb and 100 kb resolutions. [??? Where are the results?; !!!added] 

In summary, our results imply that using random under- and over-sampling, distance-type predictors, and the data at 10kb resolution results in an optimally performing cell line-specific random forest-based TAD boundary prediction model.

## TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR BINDING SITES OUTPERFORM OTHER ANNOTATION-SPECIFIC MODELS

We then aimed to compare the performances of annotation-specifc models. In doing so, we inspected the proportion of predictive importance that was explained by each of the three groups of genomic annotations (histone modifications (HM), chromatin states (ChromHMM), and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)). For optimal random forest classifiers, we found that the majority of the proportional predictive importance was obtained by transcription factor binding sites (Supplementary Figure 6). Furthermore, models build solely on TFBSs outperformed other annotation-specific models at all resolutions (Figure 4A; Supplementary Figure 7A). Notably, the TFBS-specific models outperformed models built on the combined sets of annotations, and this effect was most pronounced at lower resolutions. This indicated that the inclusion of other types of annotations contributed to additional noise rather than signal in TAD boundary prediction. In summary, these results suggest that TFBS are the primary drivers of TAD boundary formation in both the GM12878 and K562 cell lines.

## PREDICTIVE IMPORTANCES CONFIRMED BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONALITY OF CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 AT TAD BOUNDARIES

Given that many TFBS are known to colocalize together on the linear genome and are therefore highly correlated (Supplementary Figure 8), we sought to avoid overfitting by performing recursive feature elimination. We found that our models were able to obtain near-optimal performance using approximately eight TFBSs (Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure 7B). However, given that we train our models on chromosome-specific data, the most significant annotations vary for each chromosome. To determine the most common TFBSs, we clustered the predictive importance values across chromosomes (Figure 4C; Supplementary Figure 7C). We found that, similar to other studies [@sanborn2015chromatin; @fudenberg2016formation; @alipour2012self; @weintraub2017yy1; @gonzalez2017znf143], CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 transcription factors were most predictive of TAD boundary regions.

## PREDICTIVE MODELING DEFINES PRECISE AND BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LOCATION OF TAD BOUNDARIES 

After obtaining our optimally built random forest classifier, we investigated whether our predictive models can alleviate resolution limitations of Hi-C data by predicting TAD boundaries at base pair resolution. We were able to identify regions where the model predicted the base pair to be a TAD boundary with probability equal to 1. [??? Where is this figure? It seemed important] By clustering the regions (see Methods), we were able to predict a comparable number of TAD boundary regions as called by the ARROWHEAD TAD caller. However, only 24% and 29% of predicted and called (and 10 kb flanked) TAD boundaries overlapped for the GM12878 and K562 cell line, respectively, suggesting differing locations in TAD boundaries throughout the linear genome (Supplementary Figure 9). [??? Need further drill down, as we discussed] 

For each predicted TAD boundary region, we were able to identify the summit locations of TAD boundary location by performing partitioning around medoids (see Methods). To compare the summit locations of predicted and called TAD boundaries, we evaluated the signal strength of ChIP-seq peak regions around a 10 kb flanking region. We found that the signal strength for the CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 [??? Make all in this order!] TFBS peaked at our predicted TAD boudaries, while was poorly defined around the called TAD boundaries (Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 10[???; !!!fixed]).  Thus, our model is able to alleviate resolution limitations and precisely locate TAD boundaries that correspond to the highest signal strength of known TAD boundary-forming TFBSs.

ChIP-seq assays offer much higher resolutions (often in the tens of bases) compared to Hi-C sequenced data, which can be in the hundreds of kilobases. This disparity in resolution can affect a TAD caller's ability to precisely locate TADs.[??? This is for the introduction, justifying motives for your work]

# DISCUSSION

In this study we developed an ensemble framework to systematically compare model performances for different combinations of re-sampling and feature engineering techniques aimed at determining a consensus approach to predicting TAD boundary formation using genomic annotations. We provide direct comparisons of cell line specific random forest models built on a variety of different data dependent characteristics, including 4 contact matrix resolutions ($\{\textit{10 kb}, \textit{25 kb}, \textit{50 kb}, \textit{100 kb\}}$), 3 predictor-types ($\{\textit{OC}, \textit{OP}, \textit{Distance}\}$), and 4 re-sampling techniques ($\{\textit{None}, \textit{RUS}, \textit{ROS}, \textit{SMOTE}\}$), for both the GM12878 and K562 cell lines. [??? Learn Markdown] [??? What's the summary of your work?]

The experiments derived from our ensemble framework provide a useful guide toward the exploration of chromatin organization, while highlighting the impact of both class imbalance and feature engineering in TAD boundary prediction. Using the framework we demonstrated that random forest models built on imbalanced data exhibited poor performance, regardless of cell line, resolution, or predictor type. In our framework, [??? Too much "framework" mentioning] we opted to leave the test set as a completely untouched holdout set, only performing the re-sampling, and subsequent learning, on the training set. This was done so as to incur the least amount of bias and so that all conclusions could be made soley between model characteristics. As a result, we showed that Matthews Correlation Coefficient was much more sensitive to the imbalance present in the test set, compared to more popular metrics like AUROC, which attain artificially high values by correctly predicting majority class samples [??? I don't see results for it]. When comparing re-sampling techniques, we found that SMOTE re-sampling outperformed models built on both simple ROS or RUS, implying that, in fact, a combination of both random under-sampling and random over-sampling is preferred in TAD boundary prediction. Furthermore, the most improvement [??? In what?] was seen when combining SMOTE resampling on distance-type features when building random forest classifiers. These two characteristics exhibited consistently better performance results across both the GM12878 and K562 cell lines. This confirmed our hypothesis that the most granular and spatially informative representation of the relationship between TAD boundaries and annotations resulted in the best performing model.

When applying SMOTE re-sampling, with distance-type predictors, on transcription factor binding sites alone, we found that random forest classifiers performed better when compared to other annotation-specific models, including histone modifications and chromatin state segmentations. Likewise the performance of TFBS specific models was comparable to models with all annotations combined, across both cell line and resolution. This suggests that the majority of the key molecular drivers aiding in the formation of TAD boundaryies are transctiption factors, and that modifications at histone tails such as acetylation or methylation play less of a role.

We also observed that, while the best set of data characteristics were consistent across resolutions, performances of classifiers built on said characteristics tended to decline as resolution decreased. For both cell lines, top performance was achieved at the 10 kb data resolution, while the worst performance was obtained at the 50 kb and 100 kb resolution for the GM12878 and K562 cell line respectively. This suggests that TAD boundary prediction is intimately related to the resolution that boundaries are called on. This result can be attributed to one of two factors in the scheme of our framework. First, at higher resolutions, by model construction genomic bins were smaller, thereby resulting in more accurate profiles for the genomic annotations [?? Don't understand this sentence ??]. Secondly, because we are mainly concerned with TAD boundaries, and not the hierarchical structure of domains as a whole, the sparsity of contact matrices at higher resolutions does not impair boundary prediction [?? Doesn't this contradict your results about low resolution causing worse boundary prediction ??]. Conversely, lower resolutions imply larger bin windows and lead to less specificity in boundary location on the linear genome, resulting in worse performances. Given the trend in performances across resolution, future research is necessary in determining the optimal resolution to use when predicting TAD boundaries [?? Might want to qualify the statement in results about 10kb data being best by saying that it only applies to your data ??]. [??? This paragraph is a mess]

Given the formulation of our framework, we were not able to make direct comparisons between cell lines. This was due to the fact that we opted to use cell line specific annotations, and there existed some annotations that were available on the K562 cell line that were not available to GM12878, and vice versa. [??? Did they provide additional advantage?] However, we were able to confirm that final models built on the optimal set of data characteristics identified consistent and well known proteins related to the 3D structure of chromatin, for both cell lines. Our results indicated that the zinc finger protein CTCF, as well components of the cohesin complex, SMC3 and RAD21, were found to be the key molecular drivers most predictive of TAD boundary formation, consistent across cell line and resolution. In addition, models derived from our framework recognized known mediaters of long range enhancer-promoter interactions, the ZNF143 and YY1 transcription factors, as being highly predictive of TAD boundaries. 

In summary, we have shown that TAD boundary prediction is a multi-faceted problem composed of many data irregularities and characteristics that previous model have failed to address. We have shown that our proposed framework suitably addresses each of these components, while also providing the optimal considerations to make in an effort to build consensus classifiers used to predict TAD boundary formation [?? formation or location. Formation implies some temporal element ??] from functional genomic annotations. Given the stability of our results, this opens up the possibility of widening our framework to include a broader set of classifiers, cell lines, and Hi-C contact matix resolutions that will inevitably assist us in gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with the architecture of the human genome.
