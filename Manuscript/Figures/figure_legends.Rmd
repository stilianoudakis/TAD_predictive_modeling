**Figure 1: Model Construction.** The linear genome was binned according to the resolution of the Hi-C data. TAD boundaries were then flanked by 1 resolution-unit on both sides of the boundary point. [??? The following is unclear. Show Y on the figure. Are you talking about overlap only?] The response vector Y used for classification was determined by whether or not a genomic bin overlapped with a flanked region. The positional coordinates of each functional genomic element, obtained from ENCODE, were then used to define the feature space of the models.

**Figure 2. Diagram of the three predictor types considered when assessing the relationship between TAD boundaries and genomic annotations.** The _overlap count_ (OC) predictors were calculated by considering the total number of elemental regions that overlapped with each genomic bin. The _overlap percent_ (OP) predictors were calculated by dividing the sum of all feature widths within each specific bin and dividing by the total bin width. The _distance_ predictors were calculated by measuring the distance (in bases) from the center of each genomic bin to the center of the nearest elemental region of interest. The two green segments directly below the rightmost enlarged figure represent the center of the overlapping regions defining the respective genomic annotations.

**Figure 3: Ensemble Framework/Model Building Pipeline.** A diagram of the model building pipeline given an a combination of inputs from the ensemble framework. The data was split into a 7:3 training set to testing set ratio, the variable reduction technique of choice was used to minimize the number of uninformative predictors, and a random forest classification algorithm was performed. Each model was then validated on the same testing set. 

**Figure 4: Techniques for addressing class imbalance.** Barplots illustrating the class imbalance problem featured across each of the four different resolutions that were analyzed. Minority classes represent the number of genomic bins that contain a TAD boundary, while the majority classes represent the number of genomic bins that do not contain a TAD boundary. 

# Figure 5: 5kb Model Performances

Comparing model performances for TAD boundary data at 5kb resolution across each re-sampling technique. Each square plot represents a random forest classifier performed on 5kb resolution binned boundary data using a particular predictor type, variable reduction algorithm, and re-sampling technique evaluated across 4 different performance metrics.

# Figure 6: 25kb Model Performances

Comparing model performances for TAD boundary data at 25kb resolution across each re-sampling technique. Each square plot represents a random forest classifier performed on 25kb resolution binned boundary data using a particular predictor type, variable reduction algorithm, and re-sampling technique evaluated across 4 different performance metrics.

# Figure 7: 50kb Model Performances

Comparing model performances for TAD boundary data at 50kb resolution across each re-sampling technique. Each square plot represents a random forest classifier performed on 50kb resolution binned boundary data using a particular predictor type, variable reduction algorithm, and re-sampling technique evaluated across 4 different performance metrics.

# Figure 8: 100kb Model Performances

Comparing model performances for TAD boundary data at 100kb resolution across each re-sampling technique. Each square plot represents a random forest classifier performed on 10
+0kb resolution binned boundary data using a particular predictor type, variable reduction algorithm, and re-sampling technique evaluated across 4 different performance metrics.

**Figure 9: Comparing Performances** Comparing performances of random forest classification algorithms, across TAD boundary data at each resolution for models using distance-type predictors, with elastic-net regularization and random under-sampling. Performances were aggregated by taking the average of each metric across 50 iterations of random under-sampling. [??? Poor legend]

**Figure 10: Comparing Variable Importance.** Comparing variable importance for the top 15 most predictive functional genomic elements for each of the 4 different resolutions. The x-axis represents the standardized difference between the out-of-bag prediction accuracy after permutting each predictor variable, averaged across all trees. The greater the mean standardized difference, the more importance the predictor is to the model. [??? What are A/B/C/D panels?]

# Figure 11: Model Performances for all Resolutions

Comparing model performances for TAD boundary data for all 4 resolutions. The four regions represent (from left to right; top to bottom) data at 5kb, 25kb, 50kb, and 100kb resolutions. Within each region, the rows represent the set of re-sampling techniques, while the columns represent the set of performance metrics that the models were evaluated on. Each plot compares 2 sets of models; one using LASSO regularization and one using Elastic-Net regularization. Within each set, each bar represents the performance of a model with a specific predictor type; either overlap counts (OC) in red, overlap percent (OP) in green, or distance in blue.
