**Supplementary Table 1. Hi-C data.** A complete list of the Hi-C data libraries used to obtain the locations of topologically associating domains.

**Supplementary Table 2. Genomic annotations.** A complete list of the genomic annotations used to build the feature space for all downstream models. The GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly was used. "Genomic Class" - broad category of genomic features, "Element" - names of genomic features, "Available Cell Type" - the name of the cell type in which the annotation was available, "Cell Type-Specific Source" - download URL specific to the cell line (not all annotations were provided by the same institutions). 

**Supplementary Figure 1. GM12878 distance densities.** (A-D) Distances (in millions of basepairs) from the center of each genomic bin to the nearest annotation peak, for binwidths of 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb. (E-H) $Log_{2}$ transformed distances for binwidths of 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb.

**Supplementary Figure 2. K562 distance densities.** (A-D) Distances (in millions of basepairs) from the center of each genomic bin to the nearest annotation peak, for binwidths of 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb. (E-H) $Log_{2}$ transformed distances for binwidths of 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb.

**Supplementary Figure 3. Comparing ensemble system specific model performances for K562.** Performances of random forest classification models built on each of the 3 predictor types: OC (A), OP (B), and Distance (C). Within each predictor type, and across resolution, MCCs metrics were recorded for models subsequently implemented on re-sampled data using the 4 re-sampling techniques: None (red), ROS (green), RUS (blue), and SMOTE (purple). Performances were aggregated using means across each chromosome, with error bars representing 1 standard deviation away from the mean. 

**Supplementary Figure 4. Comparing annotation-specific random forest models implemented on SMOTE re-sampled data with distance-type predictors for K562.** MCC performances were compared for models using specific groups of annotations as the feature space including: histone modifications (HM; red), chromatin state segmentations (CSS; green), transcription factor binding sites (TFBS; blue), and a feature space containing all 3 types combined (combined; purple). Each bar represents a model ran through the ensemble framework, with re-sampling technique and predictor-type characteristics fixed to SMOTE and distance-types. The error bars represent $\pm$ 1 standard deviation from the mean MCC across each chromosome.

**Supplementary Figure 5. Predictive importance** A heatmap illustrating the importance of the top 20 most predictive transcription factors for random forest models implemented on SMOTE resampled data with distance-type predictors for K562. Importances were sorted according to the 10 kb resolution and rescaled to values between 0 and 100. Transcription factors with higher values of predictive importance are denoted in dark red.

**Supplementary Figure 12. Comparing $log_{2}$ distance profiles of top predictive transcription factor binding sites by bin class for 25 kb resolution, on GM12878.** Violin plots (top) and plots of differences in quantiles (bottom) between genomic bin class for 4 of the top predictive TFBS determined by the best performing model, including: SMC3 (A), ZNF143 (B), CTCF (C), and RAD21 (D). For the plots of differences in quantiles, the reference group are the genomic bins that did not overlap with a flanked TAD boundary. That is, quantile differences above 0 indicate that bins that overlapped with flanked TAD boundaries exhibited smaller quantiles.
