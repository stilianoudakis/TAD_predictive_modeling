**Supplementary Table 4. Hi-C Data.** A complete list of the Hi-C data libraries used to obtain the locations of topologically associating domains.

**Supplementary Table 1. Genomic Annotations.** A complete list of the genomic annotations used to build the feature space for all downstream models. The GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly was used. "Genomic Class" - broad category of genomic features, "Element" - names of genomic features, "Available Cell Type" - the name of the cell type in which the annotation was available, "Cell Type-Specific Source" - download URL specific to the cell line (not all annotations were provided by the same institutions). 

**Supplementary Figure 1. Distance Densities across cell lines and resolutions.** Density curves of distances (in millions of base pairs) from genomic bins to flanked TAD boundaries for 10 kb (A), 25 kb (B), 50 kb (C), and 100 kb (D) data resolutions across the GM12878 (left column) and K562 (right column) cell lines. The untransformed distance densities are filled in red, while the $log_{2}$ tranformed distance densities are filled in blue.

**Supplementary Table 5. Data Summaries and Imbalance Ratios.** The total number of genomic bins included in the complete, training, and testing sets, as well as the subsequent imbalance ratios across resolutions and cell lines. Imbalance ratio is defined as the ratio of genomic bins that overlapped a flanked TAD boundary (minority class), divided by the number of genomic bins that did not overlap a flanked TAD boundary (majority class).

**Supplementary Figure 2. Correlations between genomic annotations across cell lines and resolutions.** Upper and lower correlation heatmaps between genomic annotations for the GM12878 (A-D) and K562 (E-H) cell lines, across the 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb resolutions (A, B, C, D; and E, F, G, H respectively). The correlations were evaluated on the total number of overlapped bases between flanked TAD boundaries and genomic annotations. High correlations (red) denote annotations that tended to occur colocally near TAD boundaries. Low correlations (blue) denote annotations that did not tend to occur near TAD boundaries together.

**Supplementary Figure 3. Heatmaps illustrating the variable reduction.** An elastic-net algorithm was used to improve computational efficiency and reduce noise for both the GM12878 (A) and K562 (B) cell lines. Features that were regularized and subsequently removed from downstream modeling are denoted in white, while the features that were not regularized and kept for further analyses are denoted in red. Each vertical region is made up of a particular data resolution (10 kb, 25 kb, 50kb, and 100 kb), resampling technique (None, RUS, ROS, and SMOTE), and predictor type (OC, OP, and Distance). The yellow lines separate each of the three predictor types.

**Supplementary Figrue 4. Barplots comparing model performance for each predictor type across 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb data resolutions** Model performances were evaluated using F1-scores, MCCs, and balanced accuracies for each of the 4 resampling techniques, across both the GM12878 (A-C) and K562 (D-F) cell lines. Missing bars indicate that the model was unable to correctly predict any genomic regions that overlapped with flanked TAD boundaries in the test data, resulting in zero true positives. Bars that appear in the opposite direction (for MCC) indicate a negative correlation between the observed and predicted binary classifications of flanked TAD boundaries.

**Supplementary Figures 9-23. Precision-Recall curves for 25 kb, 50kb, and 100kb data.** Precision-recall curves were used to initially compare performance of random forest models with different predictor types on 25 kb, 50kb, and 100kb resolution data, across each resampling technique. GM12878 (solid line) and K562 (dashed line) cell lines were compared with predictor type-specific models which included overlap counts (blue), overlap percents (purple), log distance (green), and all three combined (red).

**Supplementary Table 2. Area under Precision-Recall Curves.** Comparison of models applied to different data resolutions, resampling techniques, and predictor types for each of the two cell lines in terms of AUPRC. The column labeled "All" denotes models with all 3 combined predictor types.

**Figure 3. Recursive Feature Elimination for 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb data** Beginning with the full set of distance type predictors for each cell line, models built on 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb resolution data were recursively evaluated at different subsets of feature size. For convenience and computational efficiency, feature size decreasing in powers of 2 was considered. The maximum size for feature subsets differed between cell line due the available annotations that were considered and provided in Supplementary Table 1. Near optimal performance was achieved using the top 32 distance type predictors for both the GM12878 (red) and K562 cell lines (blue).
