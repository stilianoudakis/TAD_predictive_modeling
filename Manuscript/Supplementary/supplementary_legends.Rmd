**Supplementary Table 4. Hi-C data.** A complete list of the Hi-C data libraries used to obtain the locations of topologically associating domains.

**Supplementary Table 8. Summary statistics for called TADs.** The following summary statistics were recorded regarding the average number and length of TADs (along with standard deviations) that were called using the Arrowhead algorithm [@durand2016juicebox], across each of the autosomal chromosomes (excluding chromosome 9). 

**Supplementary Table 2. Genomic annotations.** A complete list of the genomic annotations used to build the feature space for all downstream models. The GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly was used. "Genomic Class" - broad category of genomic features, "Element" - names of genomic features, "Available Cell Type" - the name of the cell type in which the annotation was available, "Cell Type-Specific Source" - download URL specific to the cell line (not all annotations were provided by the same institutions). 

**Supplementary Figure 1. Distance densities from centers of genomic bins to closest annotation.** Density curves of the distances (in millions of base pairs) from the center of genomic bins to the center of the nearest respective annotation for the GM12878 (left column) and K562 (right column) cell lines respectively. Each curve represents the raw (red) and $log_{2}$ transformed (blue) distance profiles for each annotation, across each of the 4 resolutions (A-D).

**Supplementary Table 7. Optimal alpha and lambda penalization parameters.** The tuned alpha and lambda penalization parameter terms after performing 10-fold cross validated elastic-net regularization specific to cell line, resolution, re-sampling technique, and predictor type.

**Supplementary Figure 10. Comparing ensemble system specific model performances for K562.** Performances of random forest classification models built on each of the 3 predictor types: OC (A), OP (B), and Distance (C). Within each predictor type, and across resolution, F1-Scores and MCCs metrics were recorded for models subsequently implemented on re-sampled data using the 4 re-sampling techniques: None (red), ROS (green), RUS (blue), and SMOTE (purple).

**Supplementary Table 4. Ranking predictive importance between predictor types for annotation-specific models for GM12878.** Annotation-specific random forest classification models were implemented on SMOTE resampled data, across resolution. Each model contained each of the 3 predictor types for one genomic annotation. Predictive importance was rescaled to values between 0 and 100. The predictor type with importance value of 100 indicates it was the most informative predictor type out of the 3.

**Supplementary Table 5. Ranking predictive importance between predictor types for annotation-specific models for K562.** Annotation-specific random forest classification models were implemented on SMOTE resampled data, across resolution. Each model contained each of the 3 predictor types for one genomic annotation. Predictive importance was rescaled to values between 0 and 100. The predictor type with importance value of 100 indicates it was the most informative predictor type out of the 3.

**Supplementary Figure 15. Predictive importance of genomic annotations for random forest models implemented on SMOTE resampled data with distance-type predictors for K562.** Importance was rescaled to values between 0 and 100, and discretized. The importance was subsequently sorted according to the most predictive annotations associated with the 10 kb resolution. Annotations with higher values of predictive importance are denoted in dark red, while annotations that were regularized in the pipeline for specific resolutions are denoted in grey.

**Supplementary Figure 11. Comparing category-specific random forest models implemented on SMOTE re-sampled data with distance-type predictors for K562.** Performances, separated by F1-Score and MCC, were compared for models using specific categories of annotations as the feature space including: histone modifications (red), chromatin state segmentations (green), transcription factor binding sites, and a feature space containing all 3 types combined (purple). 

**Supplementary Figure 12. Comparing $log_{2}$ distance profiles of top predictive transcription factor binding sites by bin class for 25 kb resolution, on GM12878.** Violin plots (top) and plots of differences in quantiles (bottom) between genomic bin class for 4 of the top predictive TFBS determined by the best performing model, including: SMC3 (A), ZNF143 (B), CTCF (C), and RAD21 (D). For the plots of differences in quantiles, the reference group are the genomic bins that did not overlap with a flanked TAD boundary. That is, quantile differences above 0 indicate that bins that overlapped with flanked TAD boundaries exhibited smaller quantiles.
