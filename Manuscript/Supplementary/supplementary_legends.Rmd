**Supplementary Table S1. List of Genomic Annotations.** The GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly was used. "Genomic Class" - broad category of genomic features, "Element" - names of genomic features, "Cell Type" - cell type, "Source" - download URL. [??? Did you use only features common to both cell lines?]

## Table 2: Class Distributions for Other Resolutions

Summary of the class distributions for each of the other resolution domain data sets (25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb), across each re-sampling technique. As with the 5 kb data, all re-sampling techniques yielded completely balanced classes. That is, there was a 1:1 relationship between the majority and minority classes after sampling took place.

## Table 3: Model Performances When Not Accounting for Class Imbalance

Results of various metrics used to assess predictive performances for models that were built on fully imbalanced datasets. 

## Figure 1: Performances of Models with Both SMOTE-Balanced and Randomly Over-sampled Data.

Barplots measuring the predictive performance of models built on datasets using 50 iterations of both the SMOTE algorithm (A) and random over-sampling (B).  The performance metrics considered were accuracy, AUC, F1-Score, and MCC. Performances were compared across 4 resolutions (10 kb, 25kb, 50kb, and 100 kb), for each predictor type (OC, OP, and Distances).

## Table 4:

Results of various metrics used to assess predictive performances for models that were built on random under-sampled datasets. 

## Table 5: 

Results of various metrics used to assess predictive performances for models that were built on both SMOTE-balanced and random over-sampled datasets.
