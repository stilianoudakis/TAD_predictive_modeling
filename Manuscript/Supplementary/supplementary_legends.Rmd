**Supplementary Figure 14. Number of TADs called throughout the genome.** TADs were called throughout each of the 22 autosomal chromosomes for cell lines GM12878 (red) and K562 (blue) using the Arrowhead algorithm [@durand2016juicebox], across each data resolution including 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb (A-D) respectively. 

**Supplementary Table 8. Summary statistics for TAD lengths.** The following summary statistics were recorded regarding lengths of TADs that were called and delineated into TAD boundaries including the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum TAD lengths (in basepairs). The summaries are provided for each cell line, resolution, and within each chromosome. [???should I leave space for 9th chromosome on k562 where no TADs were called?]

**Supplementary Table 2. Genomic annotations.** A complete list of the genomic annotations used to build the feature space for all downstream models. The GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly was used. "Genomic Class" - broad category of genomic features, "Element" - names of genomic features, "Available Cell Type" - the name of the cell type in which the annotation was available, "Cell Type-Specific Source" - download URL specific to the cell line (not all annotations were provided by the same institutions).

Distance densities from centers of genomic bins to closest annotation.** Density curves of the distances (in millions of base pairs) from the center of genomic bins to the center of the nearest respective annotation for the GM12878 (left column) and K562 (right column) cell lines respectively. Each curve represents the raw (red) and $log_{2}$ transformed (blue) distance profiles for each annotation, across each of the 4 resolutions (A-D).

**Supplementary Table 9. Imbalance ratios.** The mean (SD) imbalance ratios across the autosomal chromosomes for each resolution and cell line. Imbalance ratios are defined as the ratio of minority classes to majority classes are provided across resolution and cell line. The minority class is the set of genomic bins that overlap with flanked TAD boundaries, while the majority class is the set of genomic bins that do not overlap with any flanked TAD boundary.
