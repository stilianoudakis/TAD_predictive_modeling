# Table 1: List of Genomic Annoations. 

The full list of genomic annotations used in downstream analyses. These annotations were the functional genomic elements used to predict the formation of TAD boundaries. They were obtained via ChIP-Seq experiments, mapped to human genome assembly hg19, and made available by the ENCODE Consortium.

# Table 2: 5kb Class Distributions

The class distributions for different re-sampling techniques from domain data obtained from 5kb resolution contact matrices.

# Table 3: 25kb Class Distributions

The class distributions for different re-sampling techniques from domain data obtained from 25kb resolution contact matrices.

# Table 4: 50kb Class Distributions

The class distributions for different re-sampling techniques from domain data obtained from 50kb resolution contact matrices.

# Table 5: 100kb Class Distributions

The class distributions for different re-sampling techniques from domain data obtained from 100kb resolution contact matrices.
