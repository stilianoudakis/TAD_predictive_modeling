# ToDo

- Train the model on resolution-level response vector (detected TAD boundaries)
- Predict on basepair-level data - get global maximum and convert to resolution-level response vector (predicted TAD boundaries)
- Goal - to get rid of multiple false positives. Instead, we expect detected and predicted response vectors be very similar (test with flanking). Consequently, MCC or F1 may show better, more distinguishable performance.

- Dismal performance of random forest TBD

- Need legends for tables
