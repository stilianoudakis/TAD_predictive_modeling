Dear Dr Dozmorov,

 

I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to follow up with you regarding your interest in submitting to the article collection ‘Genomic Colocalization and Enrichment Analyses’ being edited by Dr Geir Kjetil Sandve, Dr Subhajyoti De, Dr Ryan Matthew Layer and Dr Eivind Hovig.

 

You previously confirmed that you would like to submit a manuscript to this collection but we have not yet received your abstract. I wanted to reach out to you to see if you are still interested in submitting your manuscript. The abstract deadline is approaching on 17th May 2019 - do you think you will be able to submit by then?

 

The abstract does not need to be the same as the one that will be submitted as part of the final manuscript. This is really just to give the Topic Editors an idea of what you are working. They would really appreciate a few sentences from you about this so they can evaluate better whether all aspects of this topic are currently being covered by the expected submissions.

 

I hope to hear from you soon.

 

Kind regards,
Kelly

Dear Dr Dozmorov,
While the analysis of colocalization of -omics features represented by genomic coordinates has extremely broad applicability for discovering mechanistic relationsships and for integrating distinct omics data, it can due to its broad and abstract nature also be a bit hard to recognize as a topic. It is extensively employed in a variety of use cases, but typically without being recognized as instances of a more general methodological approach. We are currently organizing a research topic where we aim to collect a variety of methodological contributions and applied work on the analysis of relations between -omics datasets. We believe such a collection will emphasize commonalities between different varieties and different application areas of colocalization analysis, thus laying the grounds for systematic improvements of methodology and how it is employed. If you have any upcoming methodological or applied work related to the analysis of (epi-)genomic data (aka region sets/genomic intervals/..), we would be very happy to receive it in our special issue.
In collaboration with the journal Frontiers in Genetics, we are bringing together a selected group of international experts to contribute to an open-access article collection on:
