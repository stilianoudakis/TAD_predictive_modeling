# Additional File 1

An example script for applying Arrowhead to in situ Hi-C data (HIC001-HIC018) to obtain chromosome-specific TAD boundaries on the GM12878 cell line at 5kb, 10kb, 25kb, 50kb, 100kb resolutions. An example of deepTools commands to generate plotProfiles and plotHeatmaps is also provided.
