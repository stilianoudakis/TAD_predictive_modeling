# Abstract

<!-- 100 words abstract start -->
The low resolution of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture data limits the precise mapping of boundaries of topologically associating domains and chromatin loops. We developed preciseTAD, an optimized random forest model trained on high-resolution genome annotation data (e.g., CTCF ChIP-seq) to predict the location of domain boundaries at base-level resolution. Distance between boundaries and annotations, random under-sampling, and transcription factor binding sites resulted in best model performance. preciseTAD boundaries were more enriched for CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143, and conserved across cell lines. Using genome annotations, pre-trained models can detect boundaries in cells without Hi-C data. preciseTAD is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/preciseTAD

<!--
High-throughput chromosome conformation capture technology (Hi-C) revealed extensive DNA looping and folding into discrete 3D domains. These include Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops, the 3D domains critical for cellular processes like gene regulation and cell differentiation. The relatively low resolution of Hi-C data (regions of several kilobases in size) prevents precise mapping of domain boundaries. However, the high resolution of genomic annotations associated with boundaries, such as CTCF and members of cohesin complex, suggests they can inform the precise location of domain boundaries. Several methods attempted to leverage genome annotation data for predicting domain boundaries; however, they overlooked key characteristics of the data, such as spatial associations between an annotation and a boundary, and a much smaller number of boundaries than the rest of the genome (class imbalance). 

We developed *preciseTAD*, an optimized random forest model to improve the location of domain boundaries. Trained on high-resolution genome annotation data and boundaries from low-resolution Hi-C data, the model predicts the location of boundaries at base-level resolution. We investigated several feature engineering and resampling techniques (random over- and undersampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE)) to select the most optimal data characteristics and address class imbalance. Density-based clustering (DBSCAN) and partitioning around medoids (PAM) techniques were used to identify the precise location of boundary regions and summit points. We benchmarked our method against the Arrowhead domain caller and a novel chromatin loop prediction algorithm, Peakachu, on the two most annotated cell lines. 

We found that spatial relationship (distance in the linear genome) between boundaries and annotations has the most predictive power. Random under-sampling significantly improved model performance. Transcription factor binding sites outperformed other genome annotation types. Boundaries predicted by *preciseTAD* were more enriched for CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 signal and more conserved across cell lines, highlighting their higher biological significance. The model pre-trained in one cell line performs well in another cell line. Using cell line-specific genomic annotations, the pre-trained models enable detecting domain boundaries in cells without Hi-C data.

Our study implements the method and the pre-trained models for precise domain boundary prediction using genome annotation data. The precise identification of domain boundaries will improve our understanding of how genomic regulators are shaping the 3D structure of the genome. *preciseTAD* R package is available on https://dozmorovlab.github.io/preciseTAD/ and Bioconductor (submitted).

# Background

The advent of chromosome conformation capture (3C) sequencing technologies, and its successor Hi-C, have revealed a hierarchy of the 3-dimensional (3D) structure of the human genome such as chromatin loops [@Lupianez:2015aa; @Franke:2016aa; @rao20143d; @Phanstiel:2017uq], Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) [@nora2012spatial; @dixon2012topological; @Hou:2012aa; @sexton2012three], and A/B compartments [@lieberman2009comprehensive; @rao20143d], reviewed in [@Beagan:2020wz]. At the kilobase scale, chromatin loops (corner-dot structures on Hi-C chromatin interaction maps) connect gene promoters with distal enhancers, promoting regulation of gene expression. At the megabase scale, TADs represent regions on the linear genome that are highly self-interacting. Perhaps the most prominent feature of TADs is that they are demarcated by boundaries, suggesting that most of the mammalian genome is folded into non-overlapping chromatin interaction domains [@nora2012spatial; @dixon2012topological; @Hou:2012aa; @sexton2012three]. Boundaries were found to be enriched in architectural factors such as CTCF (in convergent orientation [@rao20143d; @Tang:2015aa]), RAD21, SMC3 (members of the cohesin complex), YY1, and ZNF143 [@Dixon:2012aa; @Rao:2014aa; @Phillips-Cremins2013:aa; @Corces:2016aa; @Heidari:2014wr]. <!--Emerging evidence has linked TADs and loops to regulation of gene expression, cellular dynamics, differentiation [@phillips2013architectural; @Beagan:2020wz]. Studies have shown that TADs themselves are highly conserved across species and cell lines [@dixon2012topological; @krefting2018evolutionary; @nora2012spatial; @dixon2015chromatin; @rao20143d; @Schmitt2016aa].--> Disruption of boundaries have been reported to promote human cancers [@hnisz2016activation; @taberlay2016three; @Flavahan2016], neurological disorders [@Sun:2018aa], and pathologies of limb development [@Franke:2016aa; @lupianez2016breaking]. Thus, identifying the precise location of boundaries remains a top priority to fully understand the functionality of the human genome.

TAD and loop boundaries are not mutually exclusive. Rao et al. demonstrated that boundaries of TADs, referred to as "contact domains", are enriched in chromatin loops [@rao20143d]. Numerous observations demonstrated the presence of hierarchically nested smaller chromatin domains within TADs [@phillips2013architectural; @rao20143d], also demarcated by shared boundaries [@Norton:2018aa; @Cresswell:2020ab]. Boundaries were shown to form by the seminal 'loop extrusion' mechanism of the molecular motors (condensin and cohesin) tracking along the DNA sequence, ‘extruding’ the intervening DNA, and pausing at the convergent CTCF motifs [@Alipour:2012aa; @Fudenberg:2016aa; @Goloborodko:2016vz]. The loop extrusion mechanism is now a leading hypothesis for the formation of distinct classes of chromatin loops and contact domains [@Beagan:2020wz]. In our work, we are focusing on TAD and loop boundaries created by the loop extrusion mechanism, and refer to the associated chromatin structures as "contact domains".

The low-resolution of Hi-C data is a primary limitation for precise boundary detection. Resolution refers to the size of genomic regions (bins) used to segment the linear genome [@li2019comparison]. Because increasing resolution of Hi-C data requires a quadratic increase in the total sequencing depth [@schmitt2016genome] and the associated costs, most available Hi-C datasets have relatively low resolution, ranging from 5 kb to 100 kb.<!--While these low-resolution Hi-C datasets can be used to probe higher-order genomic patterns such as A/B compartments, more refined resolutions are necessary to accurately define TAD and loop boundaries [@fudenberg2016formation].--> Lower resolution corresponding to larger bin sizes leads to increased uncertainty in boundary location.

In contrast to low-resolution Hi-C data, functional/regulatory genome annotations (histone modifications, DNAse I hypersensitive sites, DNA methylation, and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)) assembled by the ENCODE [@ENCODE-Project-Consortium:2012aa] and other consortia have been profiled at relatively high resolution (10-300bp). The association of domain boundaries with CTCF and other architectural proteins [@rao20143d; @Tang:2015aa; @Phillips:2009aa] holds promise that these high-resolution marks may inform the more precise location of domain boundaries. Methods like Lollipop used 

GM12878 (lympho-blastoid), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia)

Random forest has been used in multiple methods (Lollipop, 3dEpiLoop, Peakachu)

RAD21 signal was the most predictive feature, followed by CTCF (Lollipop)

Lollipop used motif strength, orientation, loop size, average sequence conservation, in-between features, gene expression.

The ENCODE, NIH Roadmap Epigenomics, FANTOM5, BLUEPRINT, and other members of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) [@Stunnenberg:2016aa] have been actively cataloging functional/regulatory genome annotation datasets, such as cell type- and tissue-specific histone modifications, DNAse I hypersensitive sites, DNA methylation, and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). 

Numerous studies demonstrated the association of domain boundaries with genomic annotations [@Dixon:2015aa; @Whalen:2016aa; @Dekker:2016aa; @Bonev:2016aa; @Wang:2016ab].


Several methods have been proposed to identify genomic coordinates of TADs (reviewed in [@Zufferey:2018aa; @forcato2017comparison]), and chromatin loops [@rao20143d; @Ay:2014aa; @Heinz:2010aa; @salameh2019supervised]. However, a key limitation of them is that they depend on Hi-C data *resolution*. 

Another limitation among domain callers is that they disregard prior knowledge about functional genomic annotations associated with TAD and loop boundaries, referred hereafter as domain boundaries. The insulator binding protein, CTCF, and additional cofactors such as SMC3 and RAD21 have been identified as components of the loop extrusion model [@hansen2018recent;@sanborn2015chromatin; @fudenberg2016formation; @alipour2012self; @Mirny:2019aa; @Davidson:2019aa]. Furthermore, distinct patterns of histone modifications have also been shown to be present at boundaries [@lieberman2009comprehensive;@dixon2012topological;@libbrecht2015joint]. These genomic annotations are obtained using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). The resolution of ChIP-seq experiments is typically on the order of tens to hundreds of bases [@mendoza2009genome], well below the resolution of Hi-C data (tens of kilobases; 750 bp is the highest resolution of Hi-C data to date [@bonev2017multiscale]). Therefore, leveraging precisely mapped genomic annotations in a supervised machine learning framework enables more precise prediction of the locations of domain boundaries. 

We present *preciseTAD*, an optimally tuned machine learning framework for precise identification of domain boundaries using genome annotation data. Our method utilizes the random forest (RF) algorithm trained on high-resolution chromatin state (BroadHMM), histone modification (HM), and transcription factor binding site (TFBS) data to predict both low-resolution TAD and chromatin-loop boundaries. We introduce a systematic pipeline for building the optimal boundary region prediction classifier. We found that spatial associations (linear distance) between boundaries and annotations perform best, transcription factor binding sites improve prediction performance, and a simple random undersampling technique effectively addresses the negative effect of class imbalance. Translated from Hi-C data resolution level to base level (annotating each base and predicting its boundary probability), *preciseTAD* employs density-based clustering (DBSCAN) and partitioning around medoids (PAM) to detect genome annotation-guided boundary regions and points at a base-level resolution. This approach circumvents resolution restrictions of Hi-C data, allowing for the precise detection of biologically meaningful boundaries. We demonstrate that *preciseTAD* predictions are more enriched for known molecular drivers of 3D chromatin, including CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143. Further, we show that *preciseTAD*-predicted boundaries are more conserved across cell lines, and the model trained in one cell line can accurately predict boundaries in another cell line. This improved precision in the domain boundary location can provide insight into the association between genomic regulators and the 3D genome organization. The *preciseTAD* R package and supplementary *preciseTADhub* ExperimentHub package are freely available on Bioconductor.

# Results

## Developing an ML framework for optimal TAD boundary prediction

<!--
We developed a machine learning (ML) framework for determining the optimal set of data level characteristics to predict boundary regions of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops, collectively referred to as domain boundaries. We chose the random forest (RF) algorithm as our binary classification tool. The reason for it is two-fold: (1) to devise a tunable prediction rule in a supervised learning framework that is both robust to overfitting and able to handle multiple correlated predictors, and (2) to allow for an interpretable ranking of predictors [@boulesteix2012overview]. We used Arrowhead-called TAD boundaries [@durand2016juicer] and published Peakachu-predicted loop boundaries [@salameh2019supervised] as ground truth. Data from GM12878 and K562 cell lines at 5-100 kb resolution (Arrowhead) and 10 kb resolution (Peakachu) were used (Additional file 1: Arrowhead Script, Additional file 2: Table S1). We next developed *preciseTAD*, an R package that leverages an optimally built RF to precisely predict genomic coordinates of TAD and loop boundaries at base-level resolution from cell line-specific genome annotation data.

For TAD prediction, we derived cell line specific boundaries at 5-100 kb resolutions using *Arrowhead* [@durand2016juicer] (Additional file 1: Arrowhead Script, Additional file 2: Table S1). For chromatin loop prediction, we downloaded loops derived by *Peakachu* [@salameh2019supervised] at 10 kb (Additional file 2: Table S1). Our models were trained on cell line-specific functional genomic annotation data (ChIP-seq peak regions) publicly available through ENCODE [@encode2004encode; @davis2018encyclopedia] (Additional file 3: Table S2). We used ChIA-PET derived loop boundaries [@grubert2020landscape] (Additional file 2: Table S1), referred hereafter as *Grubert* boundaries, as the gold standard when validating our models and extracting performance metrics (See Methods). We next developed *preciseTAD*, an R package that leverages an optimally built RF to precisely predict genomic coordinates of TAD and loop boundaries at base-level resolution from cell line-specific genome annotation data.

<!--![**Resolution-specific data construction and feature engineering for random forest modeling.** (A) The linear genome was binned into non-overlapping resolution-specific intervals using *shifted binning* (see Methods). The response vector **Y** was defined as 1/0 if a genomic bin overlapped/did not overlap with a TAD (or loop) boundary. (B) Four types of associations between bins (blue dashed lines) and genomic annotations (green shapes) were considered to build the predictor space, including Average Peak Signal (Signal), Overlap Counts (OC), Overlap Percent (OP), and $log_{2}$ distance (Distance).](../main_figures/figure1.png)-->


Boundary regions were defined as genomic bins containing a called boundary ($Y = 1$), while non-boundary regions were defined as bins that did not contain a called boundary ($Y = 0$) (Figure 1A, see Methods). The total number of called TADs, their unique boundaries, and the number of genomic bins expectedly decreased with the decreased resolution of Hi-C data (Table 1, Additional file 4: Table S3). The number of non-boundary regions highly outnumbered boundary regions. Such a disproportional presence of examples in one class is known as a "class imbalance" problem that negatively affects predictive modeling [@prati2011survey; @wei2013role]. To address the class imbalance, we evaluated the effect of three resampling techniques. *Random over-sampling* (ROS) was defined as sampling with replacement from the minority class (boundary regions). *Random under-sampling* (RUS) was defined as sampling with replacement from the majority class (non-boundary regions). Lastly, we tested *Synthetic minority over-sampling technique* (SMOTE), which is a combination of both random over- and under-sampling to create balanced classes [@chawla2002smote] (see Methods).

Table: Domain boundary data and class imbalance summaries across resolutions for Arrowhead, Peakachu<!--%%%-->, and Grubert<!--%%%--> on GM12878.

A total of 77 cell line-specific genomic annotations were used to build the predictor space. These included BroadHMM chromatin state data, histone modifications (HM), and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) (Additional file 4: Table S3). Four feature engineering procedures were developed to quantify the association between genomic annotations and bins (Figure 1B). These included signal strength association (Signal), direct (OC), proportional (OP), and spatial ($log_2 + 1$ Distance) relationships (see Methods, Additional file 5: Figure S1). 

<!--%%%-->Our training/testing framework was used to determine the optimal set of data-level characteristics for TAD/loop boundary region prediction including resolution (bin size), feature engineering, and resampling (Figure 2).<!--%%%--> In total, we considered combinations of data from two cell lines *L = {GM12878, K562}*, five resolutions *R = {5 kb, 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, 100 kb}*, four types of predictor spaces *P = {Signal, OC, OP, Distance}*, and three re-sampling techniques *S = {None, RUS, ROS, SMOTE}*. Once the model inputs were established, a random forest classifier was trained on $n-1$ autosomal chromosomes, while reserving the $i^{th}$ chromosome for testing. Three-fold cross-validation was used to tune the *mtry* hyperparameter, while *ntree* and *nodesize* were fixed at 500 and at 0.1% of the rows in the training data, respectively. <!--%%%-->Models were validated on the testing data using cell line-specific Grubert-defined boundaries as $\textbf{Y}_{test}$ for gold standard comparison.<!--%%%--> Model performance was evaluated by aggregating the mean balanced accuracy (BA) across each holdout chromosome (see Methods). These strategies allowed us to select the best performing model in an unbiased manner.

The response vector $Y_N$ is defined as a boundary region ($Y=1$) if it overlaps with a genomic bin (else $Y=0$). Step 2 reserves the predictor-response matrix for the holdout chromosome $i$ as the test data. Step 3 applies a resampling technique to the training data to address the class imbalance.

## Random under-sampling, distance-based predictors, and high-resolution Hi-C data provide optimal performance for boundary prediction

Expectedly, when using data with class imbalance present, that is, no resampling, the models exhibited low balanced accuracies, with minimal variability among different resolutions (Figure 3). Similarly, poor performances were found when using ROS. However, RUS and SMOTE re-sampling led to a drastic improvement in performance, especially at higher resolutions. We found that RUS marginally outperformed SMOTE as the optimal class balancing technique for all resolutions and predictor types when predicting TAD boundary regions. 

Additionally, we found that using a distance-type predictor space yielded substantially higher balanced accuracy than the peak signal strength, overlap count, and overlap percent predictor types. As with class balancing techniques, this improvement was less evident at lower resolutions, with results consistent for K562 (Additional file 6: Figure S2A). Furthermore, 5 kb resolution genomic bins led to the optimal prediction for TAD boundary regions on both cell lines. Random forest models built on Peakachu-defined loop boundary regions yielded optimal prediction performance when using a distance-type predictor space, with RUS marginally outperforming SMOTE, for both cell lines (Additional file 6: Figure S2B, S2C). Our results indicate that random under-sampling, distance-type predictors, and high-resolution Hi-C data provide the optimal set of data level characteristics for both TAD and chromatin loop boundary prediction.

## Transcription factor binding sites outperform histone- and chromatin state-specific models

We hypothesized that the class of genomic annotation may also affect predictive performance. Using the established optimal settings (RUS, Distance, 5 kb/10 kb (Arrowhead/Peakachu ground truth) genomic bins), we built separate random forest models using histone modifications (HM), BroadHMM chromatin states (BroadHMM), and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We found that models built on TFBSs outperformed other annotation-specific models, with results consistent for loop boundaries, on both cell lines (Figure 4A; Additional file 7: Figure S3A). These results suggest that TFBS are the primary drivers of TAD and loop boundary formation in both GM12878 and K562.

## Predictive importances confirmed the biological role of CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 for boundary formation

We sought to further optimize our boundary region prediction models by implementing recursive feature elimination to avoid overfitting and selecting only the most influential TFBS across all autosomal chromosomes. We were able to obtain near-optimal performance using approximately eight TFBS (Figure 4B; Additional file 7: Figure S3B). However, given that we trained our models on chromosome-specific data, the most significant annotations varied for each holdout chromosome. To determine transcription factors most important for boundary prediction across all chromosomes, we clustered the predictive importance (mean decrease in accuracy) of the top eight significant TFs across chromosomes. We found four transcription factors, CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143, being consistently predictive of TAD and loop boundaries (Figure 4C; Additional file 7: Figure S3C). We optimized our model by only considering these top four TFBS when building the random forest model, thereby decreasing computational burden while maintaining high predictive performance. In summary, our model was able to yield the known molecular drivers of the loop extrusion model [@hansen2018recent;@sanborn2015chromatin; @fudenberg2016formation; @alipour2012self; @Mirny:2019aa; @Davidson:2019aa], suggesting that TAD and loop formation are carried out by similar mechanisms. 

## Training in one cell line accurately predicts boundary regions in other cell lines 

Having demonstrated the optimal performance in our framework's ability to predict boundary regions, we next attempted to predict boundary regions in one cell line using the model pre-trained on data from another cell line (See Methods). We found that training and testing using Arrowhead ground truth TAD boundaries and genomic annotation data from the GM12878 cell line resulted in an average AUC=<!--0.792--> <!--%%%--> 0.840<!--%%%--> (Figure 4D). Interestingly, when training on the K562 cell line and testing on GM12878, the average AUC increased slightly to <!--0.795--> <!--%%%--> 0.899<!--%%%-->. Likewise, the average performance of models trained using Peakachu boundaries and genomic annotation data from the GM12878 cell line was comparable to models trained on K562-specific Peakachu boundaries and genomic annotations (Avg. AUC=<!--0.881--> <!--%%%--> 0.923<!--%%%--> and <!--0.874--> <!--%%%--> 0.876<!--%%%-->, respectively (Figure 4D)). These results were consistent when comparing training/testing strategies on K562 with training on GM12878 and testing on K562 data (Additional file 7: Figure S3D). In both instances the average ROC curves were found to be within 1 standard deviation of each other, suggesting that a model trained on data from one cell line performs well when using the data from another cell line, allowing for the opportunity to predict boundaries for cell lines that do not currently have Hi-C data available.

## *preciseTAD* identifies precise and biologically relevant domain boundaries

Using our optimally built random forest model trained on Arrowhead/Peakachu boundaries, we attempted to predict boundaries at base-level resolution. Intuitively, instead of bin-level annotations, the predictor-response space was built on a base-level, that is, each base was associated with a genomic annotation. The model trained on a bin-level space was then applied on a base-level space to predict each base's probability of being a boundary. Our method, referred to as *preciseTAD*, uses density-based spatial clustering (DBSCAN) and partitioning around medoids (PAM) to predict the location of boundary regions and summit points (highest boundary probability) at base-level resolution (see Methods; Additional file 8: Figure S4).

When trained using Arrowhead and Peakachu ground truth boundaries at 5 kb and 10 kb, respectively, the *preciseTAD* model predicted a total of 12,258 TAD and 15,707 chromatin loop boundaries in GM12878, as well as 9,603 TAD and 11,154 chromatin loop boundaries in K562 cell line (Additional file 9: Table S4). We reported less predicted TAD boundaries at 5 kb than Arrowhead on both cell lines (Table 1, Additional file 4: Table S3). This can be attributed to Arrowhead's inflation of called TADs at 5 kb, that, when visualized, often do not correspond to domains enriched in internal interactions (Figure 5A) and signal of known drivers of domain boundaries (Figure 5B). *preciseTAD* also predicted fewer chromatin loop boundaries than Peakachu (Table 1, Additional file 4: Table S3). This can be attributed to Peakachu's use of only CTCF sites to call boundaries, while *preciseTAD* leverages four known drivers of 3D chromatin, including CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143. These results suggest that genome annotation-driven predicted boundaries may be more biologically relevant than those detected from Hi-C data alone.

Next, we evaluated the biological significance of *preciseTAD* boundary points. The signal of four known molecular drivers of 3D chromatin (CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143) colocalized more frequently around *preciseTAD*-predicted boundary points, as compared to Arrowhead-called TAD and Peakachu loop boundaries, respectively (<!--Figure 5C, 5D; Additional file 10: Figure S5A, S5B--> <!--%%%-->Figure 6A, 6B; Additional file 10: Figure S5A, S5B <!--%%%-->). <!--%%%-->Additionally, we found that when trained on cohesin-mediated chromatin loops, *preciseTAD*-predicted boundaries showed similar levels of colocalization to the set of ChIA-PET derived loop boundaries (Figure 6C; Additional file 10: Figure S5C).<!--%%%--> Surprised by the poor signal distribution around Arrowhead and Peakachu boundaries, we compared signals centered on boundaries called by Arrowhead, Peakachu, <!--%%%-->Grubert,<!--%%%--> and our SpectralTAD [@Cresswell:2020ab] TAD caller.

These results indicate that *preciseTAD*-predicted boundaries better reflected the known biology of boundary formation when compared to a novel TAD-caller or loop prediction algorithm.<!--%%%-->

## *preciseTAD* boundaries are more conserved across cell lines

<!--
Previous studies suggest that TAD boundaries are conserved across cell lines [@dixon2012topological; @krefting2018evolutionary; @nora2012spatial; @sexton2012three]. To assess the level of cross-cell-line conservation, we evaluated the overlap between cell line-specific boundaries detected by *preciseTAD*, Arrowhead, and Peakachu. Only 26% and 49% of boundaries were conserved between cell lines for Arrowhead and Peakachu boundaries (J=0.186 and J=0.388), respectively (Figure 6B, 6D). However, 45%/56% of *preciseTAD*-predicted domain boundaries were conserved between GM12878 and K562 cell lines when using models trained on Arrowhead/Peakachu data (J=0.383 and J=0.444, respectively, Figure 6C, 6E). The better conservation of *preciseTAD*-predicted boundaries further supports the notion of their higher biological relevance.

## Boundaries predicted by *preciseTAD* models trained on TAD and loop boundaries are highly overlapping

<!--
The majority of boundaries predicted by the Arrowhead-trained *preciseTAD* model represented a subset of the larger group of boundaries predicted by the Peakachu-trained model (Additional file 14: Figure S9). This is expected as loop boundaries detected by Peakachu are more abundant, while comparatively wide TAD boundaries detected by Arrowhead likely represent the higher level of the 3D chromatin organization. Together with the results in Figure 4C, the high overlap between boundaries predicted by Arrowhead- and Peakachu-trained models suggests that TAD and loop boundaries may be driven by similar molecular mechanisms.

<!--%%%-->

Guided by the high predictive performance when training and testing on different cell lines (Figure 4D), we opted to evaluate whether models trained using Arrowhead/Peakachu<!--%%%-->/Grubert<!--%%%--> ground truth data using *preciseTAD* in one cell line could be leveraged to predict boundaries using annotation data from another cell line. We evaluated two scenarios: 1) training on GM12878 and predicting boundaries on GM12878 (GM on GM) vs. training on K562 and predicting on GM12878 (K on GM), and 2) training on K562 and predicting boundaries on K562 (K on K) vs. training on GM12878 and predicting boundaries on K562 (GM on K). Using Arrowhead-trained models, 76% (J=0.701) and 81% (J=0.751) of predicted boundaries overlapped in both cross-cell-line prediction scenarios (<!--Additional file 15: Figure S10A, S10B--> <!--%%%-->Additional file 17: Figure S12<!--%%%-->). When using Peakachu-trained models, we observed 85% (J=0.705) and 88% (J=0.759) overlap (<!--Additional file 15: Figure S10C, S10D--> <!--%%%-->Additional file 18: Figure S13<!--%%%-->). <!--%%%-->Lastly, when using Grubert-trained models, we observed 86% (J=0.698) and 80% (J=0.0.660) overlap (Additional file 19: Figure S14).<!--%%%--> Furthermore, boundaries predicted on unseen annotation data exhibited a similar level of enrichment for CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 as did those trained and predicted on the same cell line (Additional files 17-19: Figure S12-S14). These results indicate that *preciseTAD* pre-trained models can be successfully used to accurately predict both TAD and loop boundaries for cell lines lacking Hi-C data but for which genome annotation data is available.

# Discussion

<!--
We present *preciseTAD*, a machine learning approach for precise prediction of TAD and chromatin loop boundaries from functional genomic annotations. *preciseTAD* leverages a random forest (RF) classification model built on low-resolution domain boundaries obtained from domain calling tools, and high-resolution genomic annotations as the predictor space. *preciseTAD* predicts the probability of each base being a boundary, and identifies the precise location of boundary regions and the most likely boundary points. *preciseTAD* was benchmarked against two boundary calling tools, Arrowhead [@durand2016juicebox], an established TAD-caller, and Peakachu [@salameh2019supervised] a recently published algorithm for predicting chromatin loops. We first optimized our RF model by systematically comparing different combinations of genome binning (resolution), feature engineering procedures, and resampling techniques. Our results demonstrate that genomic distance between boundary regions and genomic annotations coupled with random under-sampling results in the best model performance. We show that binding of four transcription factors (SMC3, RAD21, CTCF, ZNF143) is sufficient for accurate boundary predictions. *preciseTAD* is implemented as an R package, provides the pre-trained models, and allows for precise prediction of boundaries for any cell line for which the genomic annotations are available.

We first optimized our RF model by systematically comparing different combinations of genome binning (resolution), feature engineering procedures, and resampling techniques.

These open source tools allow for precise prediction of boundaries for any cell line for which the genomic annotations are available.
<!--%%%%-->

Our machine learning framework yielded several interesting observations. We first demonstrated that RF models built using *distance*-type predictors outperformed models built on previously published feature engineering techniques, including signal strength, overlap counts, and overlap percents [@mourad2016computational; @Moore:2015aa; @Al-Bkhetan:2018aa; @kai2018predicting]. We further demonstrated that class imbalance hinders boundary prediction, but can be effectively addressed by a simple random under-sampling technique, an aspect of boundary prediction unaddressed in previous studies [@mourad2016computational; @Moore:2015aa; @Al-Bkhetan:2018aa]. We showed that information about only four transcription factors (CTCF, SMC3, RAD21, ZNF143) is necessary and sufficient for accurate boundary prediction, outperforming histone modification- and BroadHMM-built models [@Moore:2015aa; @Al-Bkhetan:2018aa]. These are known components of the loop extrusion model, an established theory of how loops are made by a ring-shaped adenosine triphosphatase-driven complex called cohesin [@hansen2018recent; @sanborn2015chromatin; @fudenberg2016formation; @alipour2012self; @Mirny:2019aa; @Davidson:2019aa]. Interestingly, the same transcription factors accurately predicted both TAD and loop boundaries, suggesting a similarity of the mechanisms of TAD and loop formation. This suggested that the random forest model, when tuned and feature engineered correctly, is highly effective in predicting biologically relevant domain boundaries. 

Besides balanced accuracy (BA), we investigated five other performance metrics, including accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), precision, F1-score, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) (<!--Additional file 16: Table S5--> <!--%%%-->Additional file 20: Table S5<!--%%%-->). Our aim was to have a balanced metric sensitive to class imbalance such that it would not favor one component of the confusion matrix. The accuracy metric can be artificially inflated by true negatives (TN), the set of genomic bins correctly predicted as not containing a ground truth boundary. AUROC captures how a model generally performs across different thresholds. However, it doesn't emphasize one class over the other, so it does not reflect the minority class well. Precision indicates the rate at which positive predictions are correct and can be artificially deflated by low proportions of true positives (TP), the set of genomic bins correctly predicted as containing a ground truth boundary. While F1-score is a composite metric, it can be susceptible to different values for precision and recall. Lastly, AUPRC is insensitive toward class imbalance, preventing us from investigating its effect, and also omits TN values from its calculation. All of these are important considerations to make when choosing a performance metric. For these reasons, we opted to report balanced accuracy (BA). The BA benefits from incorporating all components of the confusion matrix, while also being sensitive to class imbalance, a necessary characteristic when comparing performances to models built using no data resampling. 

Guided by both low-resolution Hi-C data and high-resolution genome annotation data, *preciseTAD* predicts base-level resolution boundaries, alleviating resolution limitations of Hi-C data. However, a natural question is how resolution (width) of boundary regions identified by *preciseTAD* (PTBRs) compares with that of Hi-C data. Our preliminary observations indicate that, under most optimal settings, the width of PTBRs parallels the resolution of Hi-C data. Furthermore, each PTBR is formed by several sub-regions with the probability of being a boundary defined by the threshold $t$ ($t=1$ in the current study). Yet, the preciseTAD boundary points (PTBPs, medoids identified within each PTBR) had the highest density of CTCF and other transcription factor binding signal (Figure 5). Our results are in line with the emergent view that domain boundaries are flexible [@chang2020tads; @Maeshima:2020aa], and their well-defined location arises as a consequence of the population average in bulk Hi-C data [@fudenberg2016formation; @Flyamer:2017aa].

We show that, unlike Arrowhead, *preciseTAD* does not inflate the number of predicted boundaries, providing only the most biologically meaningful TAD boundaries that demarcate regions of high inter-chromosomal interactions. *preciseTAD* boundaries predicted using models trained on either TAD or loop boundaries were enriched for known architectural transcription factors including CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143, supporting recent observations that TADs and loops may be generated by similar mechanisms [@hansen2018recent]. Likewise, *preciseTAD* boundaries were more conserved between GM12878 and K562 cell lines, a known feature among the 3D architecture of the human genome, further highlighting their biological significance.

*preciseTAD* offers flexibility in controlling both the number of predicted boundaries and the distance between them. The two primary parameters are the probability threshold $t$ and $\epsilon$ (referred to as eps; parameter of DBSCAN). The combination of these two quantities changes the resulting number of predicted boundaries from *preciseTAD*. Lower values of $t$ and $\epsilon$ will result in more clusters of bases, and therefore, more boundaries. As a heuristic, we evaluated the pairwise combination of 3 different thresholds ($t=(0.975,0.99,1.0)$) and 6 different $\epsilon$ values ($\epsilon=(1000,5000,10000,15000,20000,25000)$)). We found that the normalized overlaps - calculated as the total number of ChIP-seq peaks that overlapped within a given flanked boundary, divided by the number of boundaries - between top TFBS sites and flanked *preciseTAD* boundaries converged for combinations of $t=1.0$ and $\epsilon=10000$ (<!--Additional file 17: Figure S11--> <!--%%%-->Additional file 21: Figure S15<!--%%%-->).

A limitation of *preciseTAD* is that it is dependent on the "ground truth" boundaries provided by a domain caller. Given the wide variety of domain callers and their variable performance [@Zufferey:2018aa; @forcato2017comparison], defining "ground truth" boundaries is challenging. Ultra-deep Hi-C sequencing [@bonev2017multiscale] and newer technologies for precise mapping of chromatin interactions (e.g., Micro-C [@Krietenstein:2020aa]), coupled with more precise technologies for genomic annotation profiling (e.g., CUT&RUN for precise mapping of transcription factor binding sites) will help to refine the location and the genomic signatures of the "ground truth" boundaries. In the current work, we feel that the total number of domain boundaries is sufficient to guide learning of the association between genomic annotations and boundaries for precise boundary predictions. Indeed, models trained on the larger number of Peakachu-defined boundaries performed better than those trained on Arrowhead boundaries. Although we provide models trained on both boundary types in *preciesTADhub*, we recommend Peakachu-trained models for the base-level prediction of domain boundaries.

Another limitation of *preciseTAD* is that it does not distinguish boundary types. The hierarchical nature of TAD boundaries [@weinreb2016identification; @fraser2015hierarchical; @Cresswell:2020ab] is not considered by *preciseTAD* due to the lack of gold standard of TAD hierarchy. *preciseTAD* also does not consider the directionality of CTCF binding [@Harrold:2020aa] as it predicts individual boundaries in contrast to pairs of convergent CTCF motifs marking individual domains. Recent research distinguishes CTCF-associated boundaries, CTCF-negative YY1-enriched boundaries, CTCF- and YY1- depleted promoter boundaries, and the fourth class of weak boundaries largely depleted of all three features [@Krietenstein:2020aa]. Furthermore, actively transcribed regions can serve as TAD boundaries themselves, independently of CTCF binding [@Harrold:2020aa]. This may lead to some TAD boundaries being undetected by *preciseTAD* despite being detected by domain callers. Our future work will involve incorporating the directionality of CTCF binding in predictive modeling, including additional predictor types, and defining separate models trained on different boundary types.

Using the provided pre-trained models, *preciseTAD* can identify precise domain boundaries using cell line-specific genome annotation information of only four transcription factors, including CTCF, SMC3, RAD21, and ZNF143. Although the ENCODE, NIH Roadmap Epigenomics, FANTOM5, BLUEPRINT, and other members of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) [@Stunnenberg:2016aa] have been actively cataloging cell line-specific genome annotation datasets, these data remain very sparse. To date (September 2020), the ENCODE project has only five cell lines (GM12878, K562, H1-hESC, HeLa-S3, HepG2) with all four transcription factor genomic annotations. Efforts to impute missing cell line-specific genome annotation information [@Schreiber:2020aa] started to appear. We envision the broader availability of cell line-specific genomic annotations will enable a more systematic analysis of domain boundaries using *preciseTAD*. 

# Conclusion

In summary, we demonstrate that domain boundary prediction is a multi-faceted problem requiring consideration of multiple statistical and biological properties of genomic data. Simply considering the properties of Hi-C contact matrices ignores the fundamental roles of known molecular drivers of 3D chromatin structures. Instead, we propose *preciseTAD*, a supervised machine learning framework that leverages both Hi-C contact matrix information and genomic annotations. Our method introduces three concepts - *shifted binning*, *distance*-type predictors, and *random undersampling* - which we use to build random forest classification models for predicting boundary regions. Our method can bridge the resolution gap between 1D ChIP-seq annotations and 3D Hi-C sequencing data for more precise and biologically meaningful boundary identification. We introduce *preciseTAD*, an open source R package for leveraging random forests to predict domain boundaries at base-level resolution. We hope that *preciseTAD* will serve as an efficient and easy-to-use tool to further explore the genome's 3D organization.

# Methods

## Data sources

TAD and loop boundaries called by *Arrowhead* [@durand2016juicebox] and *Peakachu* [@salameh2019supervised] tools were used for training and testing. The autosomal genomic coordinates in the GRCh37/hg19 human genome assembly were considered. Arrowhead-defined TAD boundaries were called from Hi-C data for the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (MAPQ>0, 5 kb, 10 kb, 25 kb, 50 kb, and 100 kb resolutions) using the default parameters (Additional file 1: Arrowhead Script). Peakachu chromatin loop boundaries called at 10 kb for the GM12878, and K562 cell lines were downloaded from the Yue lab website (Additional file 2: Table S1). <!--%%%-->Additionally cohesin-mediated chromatin loops mapped via chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) were downloaded for GM12878 and K562 [@grubert2020landscape] (Additional file 2: Table S1), which we refer to as *Grubert*.<!--%%%--> For loops, unique boundaries were considered as the midpoints within the coordinate of each chromatin loop anchor. Chromosome 9 was excluded from all downstream analyses due to the sparsity of contact matrices at 5 kb and 10 kb resolutions for the K562 cell line. Cell-line-specific genomic annotations (BroadHMM chromatin states (BroadHMM), histone modifications (HM), and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)) were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser Database [@Tyner:2017aa] (Additional file 3: Table S2). 

## Shifted-binning for binary classification

In Hi-C, each chromosome is binned into non-overlapping regions of length *r*, typically, 5 kb and above. The *r* parameter defines the resolution of Hi-C data. Here, we designed a strategy called _shifted binning_ that partitions the genome into regions of the same length *r*, but with middle points corresponding to boundaries defined by the original binning. 

To create shifted binning, the first shifted bin was set to start at half of the resolution *r* and continued in intervals of length *r* until the end of the chromosome (*mod r* + *r/2*). The shifted bins, referred hereafter as bins for simplicity, were then defined as boundary-containing regions (*Y = 1*) if they contained a TAD (or loop) boundary, and non-boundary regions (*Y = 0*) otherwise, thus establishing the binary response vector (**Y**) used for classification (Figure 1A).

## Feature engineering

Cell line-specific genomic annotations were used to build the predictor space. Bins were annotated by one of either the average signal strength of the corresponding annotation (*Peak Signal Strength*), the number of overlaps with an annotation (*Overlap Count (OC)*), the percent of overlap between the bin and the total width of genomic annotation regions overlapping it (*Overlap Percent (OP)*), or the distance in bases from the center of the bin to the center of the nearest genomic annotation region (*Distance*) (Figure 1B). A ($log_2 + 1$)-transformation of distance was used to account for the skewness of the distance distributions  (Additional file 5: Figure S1). Models built using a *Peak Signal Strength* predictor space were only composed of histone modifications and transcription factor binding sites because BroadHMM chromatin states lack signal values.

## Addressing class imbalance

To assess the impact of class imbalance (CI), defined as the proportion of boundary regions to non-boundary regions, we evaluated three resampling techniques: *Random Over-Sampling (ROS)*, *Random Under-Sampling (RUS)*, and *Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE)*. For ROS, the minority class was sampled with replacement to obtain the same number of data points in the majority class. For RUS, the majority class was sampled without replacement to obtain the same number of data points in the minority class. For SMOTE, under-sampling was performed without replacement from the majority class, while over-sampling was performed by creating new synthetic observations using the $k=5$ minority class nearest neighbors [@chawla2002smote] (implemented in the `DMwR` v.0.4.1 R package). We restricted the SMOTE algorithm to 100% over-sampling and 200% under-sampling to create perfectly balanced classes. 

## Establishing optimal data level characteristics for TAD boundary region prediction

Random forest (RF) classification models (the `caret` v.6.0 R package [@kuhn2012caret]) were built to compare model performances between combinations of data resolutions, feature engineering procedures, and resampling techniques. Following recommendations to evaluate the model on unseen data [@schreiber2019pitfall], a *holdout chromosome* technique was used for estimating model performance. The $i^{th}$ holdout chromosome was identified and a data matrix, $A_{N \times (p+1)}$, was constructed by combining the binned genome from the remaining chromosomes ($1,2,\cdots, i-1,i+1,\cdots,21,22$), where $N=[n_{1} n_{2} \cdots n_{21} n_{22}]'$ and $n_{k}$ is the length of chromosome *k* after being binned into non-overlapping regions of resolution *r*, such that $k \ne i$. The number of annotations, $p$, and the response vector, **Y**, defined the column-wise dimension of the matrix $A$. Re-sampling was then performed on $A$, and an RF classifier was trained using 3-fold cross-validation to tune for the number of annotations to consider at each node (*mtry*). The number of trees (*ntree*) that were aggregated for each RF model was set to 500. The minimum number of observations per root node (*nodesize*) was set to 0.1% of the rows in the data. The binned data for the holdout chromosome $i$ was reserved for testing. <!--%%%-->The response vector associated with the testing data ($\textbf{Y}_{test}$) was built using Grubert-defined chromatin loops as a gold standard when validating the models.<!--%%%--> Models were then evaluated using Balanced Accuracy (BA), defined as the average of sensitivity and specificity:

$$BA = \dfrac{1}{2}\left( sensitivity + specificity \right) = \dfrac{1}{2}\left( \dfrac{TP}{TP+FN} + \dfrac{TN}{TN+FP} \right)$$

## Feature selection and predictive importance

Many genomic annotations, notably architectural proteins, tend to exhibit an extensive pattern of colocalization (correlation) [@van2014insulator]. To suitably reduce the predictor space and improve computational efficiency, while maintaining optimal performance, we implemented recursive feature elimination (RFE). We estimated the near-optimal number of necessary features, ranging from 2 to the maximum number of features incremented by the power of 2. We then aggregated the predictive importance of the union of the optimal set of features across holdout chromosomes using the mean decrease in node impurity among permuted features in out-of-bag samples to determine the most common and top-ranked annotations for predicting boundary regions. 

## Evaluating performance across cell lines

We used the same holdout chromosome strategy to evaluate a model trained in one cell line on unseen data from another cell line [@schreiber2019pitfall]. Given two cell lines, GM12878 and K562, we first evaluated the performance of cell line-specific models. That is, models trained on cell line-specific data from $n-1$ chromosomes were evaluated on the $i^{th}$ holdout chromosome data from the same cell line. Second, we evaluated models trained on cell line-specific data from $n-1$ chromosomes using the $i^{th}$ holdout chromosome data from a different cell line. That is, models trained using K562 cell line-specific data were evaluated on unseen chromosome data from the GM12878 cell line. This process was repeated for each holdout chromosome. To evaluate performance, we constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves composed of the average sensitivities and specificities at different cutoffs, across each holdout chromosome, and reported the corresponding average area under the curve (AUC). <!--%%%-->As before, the response vector for the test data was derived from cell line-specific Grubert boundaries.<!--%%%-->

## Boundary prediction at the base-level resolution using *preciseTAD*

To investigate whether we could alleviate the resolution limitations of conventional domain calling tools, we developed *preciseTAD*. This algorithm leverages an optimized random forest model in conjunction with density-based and partitioning techniques to predict boundaries at base-level resolution (Additional file 8: Figure S4). 

A random forest model $(M)$ was built on the optimal combination of predictor type (predictor space), resampling technique (class balancing correction), and top-ranked annotations (most informative genomic elements) for a set of binned chromosomes $\{k | k \ne i \}$. To precisely identify boundary locations, we first constructed a _base-level resolution_ predictor space for the chromosome *i*, $A_{n \times p}$, where $n$ is the length of chromosome $i$ and $p$ is the optimal number of annotations. We then evaluate $M$ on the base-level predictor space to extract the probability vector, $\pi_{n}$, denoting each base's probability of being a boundary. A threshold $t$ specifies the probability at which a base with $\pi_{n} \ge t$ is designated as a potential boundary (the default $t=1$). Next, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN; version 1.1-5) is applied to the matrix of pairwise genomic distances between boundary-annotated bases, $D$, such that $\pi_{n} \ge t$. The minimum and maximum coordinates of each cluster, $k$, of spatially colocalized bases were termed *preciseTAD boundary regions* (PTBR). To precisely identify a single base among each PTBR, *preciseTAD* implements partitioning around medoids (PAM) on the distance matrix, $D_{k}$, derived from each cluster. The corresponding cluster medoid was defined as a *preciseTAD boundary point* (PTBP), making it the most representative base coordinate within each clustered PTBR.

The DBSCAN algorithm has two parameters, *MinPts* and *eps* ($\epsilon$). The *MinPts* parameter was set to the recommended value of 3, representing $1+dim(data)$ [@hahsler2019dbscan]. To decide on the optimal value of $t$ and $\epsilon$ in *preciseTAD*, we considered the normalized enrichment ($NE$) of flanked predicted boundaries, defined as

$$NE = \dfrac{1}{p} \left[ \Sigma_{s=1}^{p} \left[ \dfrac{1}{b} \Sigma_{k=1}^{b} e_{ks} \right] \right]$$

where $e_{ks} = \textbf{I}\{ r_{s} \in (b_{k}-f, b_{k}+f)\}$ is the number of elemental regions $r$ of predictor $p$ that overlap with each flanked boundary. We evaluated $NE$ for combinations of $t=\{0.975, 0.99, 1.0 \}$ and $\epsilon = \{1000, 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000 \}$. The heuristic of $\epsilon$ is that density-reachable bases with genomic distances less than $\epsilon$ should occupy the same designated cluster. The default combination was set to $t=1.0$ and $\epsilon=10000$ based on our tests (Additional file 17: Figure S11).

## Evaluating called and predicted boundary precision

We assessed the biological significance of our predicted boundaries by their association with the signal of CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 using *deepTools* (version 2.0) [@ramirez2016deeptools] (*computeMatrix*, *plotProfile*, and *plotHeatmap* tools). Additionally, we compared the median $log_2$ genomic distances between TAD boundaries and the same top predictive ChIP-seq annotations using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests. Furthermore, we compared the overlap between predicted and called boundaries in GM12878 and K562 cell lines. Boundaries were first flanked by resolution, *r*, and overlaps were visualized using Venn diagrams from the `Vennerable` R package (version 3.1.0). Overlaps were further quantified using the Jaccard index defined as

$$J_{(A,B)} = \dfrac{A \cap B}{A \cup B}$$

where A and B represent genomic regions created by flanked called and predicted boundaries. That is, between cell lines, the number of overlapping flanked boundaries divided by the total number of flanked boundaries. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests were used to compare chromosome-specific Jaccard indices across cell lines, between *preciseTAD* boundaries and both Arrowhead and Peakachu boundaries, respectively. All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.1). The significance level was set to 0.05 for all statistical tests.

<!--using the `EnrichedHeatmap` R package (version 1.14.0) [@gu2018enrichedheatmap]. For each boundary (both called and predicted), a 5000 bp flank was created on either side. The flanking was broken up into 50 bp segments, for a total of 100 windows on both sides of a given boundary. A coverage value was generated for each window with respect to a given ChIP-seq annotation, as the mean signal averaged by the width of the window, denoted by,

$$v_{c} = \dfrac{\Sigma_{j}^{m} \Sigma_{i}^{n}x_{ij}w_{ij}}{L}$$

where $x_{ij}$ is the total number of bases of annotation $i$ in window $j$ and $w_{ij}$ is the number of bases that overlap between annotation $i$ and window $j$. The denominator, $L$, is the width of the windows (here, $L=50$). The rows of the heatmaps are ordered by enriched scores. The enriched scores are calculated as the sum of coverage values weighted by the distance to the flanked boundary, denoted by

$$s_{e} = \Sigma_{d=1}^{n_{1}}\left(\dfrac{x_{1d}* d}{n_{1}} \right) + \Sigma_{u=1}^{n_{2}}\left(\dfrac{x_{2u}* (n_{2} - u + 1)}{n_{2}} \right)$$
where $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ represent the number of downstream and upstream coverage values to sum over. Here, $n_{1}=n_{2}=100$.-->


<!--%%%new paragraph-->
## Predicting boundaries across cell lines

We extended the *preciseTAD* algorithm by implementing a strategy to predict domain boundaries across cell lines. To do so, we applied *preciseTAD* on models built using cell line-specific annotation data to predict boundaries on base-level annotation data from another cell line. We compared this strategy to applying *preciseTAD* on models and base level annotation data from the same cell line. Results were compared by assessing the overlap between flanked same-cell-line and cross-cell-line predicted boundaries using venn diagrams and Jaccard indices.

Averaged balanced accuracies are compared for Peakachu-trained models built on (B) GM12878 and (C) K562 within each predictor-type: Signal, OC, OP, and Distance, and across resampling technique: no resampling (None; red), random over-sampling (ROS; green), random under-sampling (RUS; blue), and synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE; purple). Error bars indicate 1 standard deviation from the mean performance across each holdout chromosome used for testing.

**Additional File 7: Figure S3. SMC3, RAD21, CTCF, and ZNF143 transcription factors accurately predict TAD and loop boundaries in K562.** (A) Barplots comparing performances of TAD (Arrowhead) and loop (Peakachu) boundary prediction models using histone modifications (HM), chromatin states (BroadHMM), transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), in addition to a model containing all three classes (ALL). (B) Recursive feature elimination (RFE) analysis used to select the optimal number of predictors. Error bars represent 1 standard deviation from the mean cross-validated accuracy across each holdout chromosome. (C) Clustered heatmap of the predictive importance for the union of the top 8 most predictive chromosome-specific TFBSs. The columns represent the holdout chromosome excluded from the training data. Rows are sorted in decreasing order according to the columnwise average importance. (D) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding average area under the curves (AUCs) when training and testing on K562 data (blue, Arrowhead ground truth; red, Peakachu ground truth) versus training on GM12878 and testing on K5628 data (black, dashed). The curves represent the average sensitivities and specificities across each holdout chromosome. The shaded areas around each curve represent 1 standard deviation from the average.

**Additional File 9: Table S4.** hg19/GRCh37 genomic coordinates of *preciseTAD*-predicted boundary regions (PTBR) and points (PTBP) for GM12878 and K562 cell lines, using models trained on Arrowhead, Peakachu, and Grubert TAD/chromatin loop boundaries as ground truth. For PTBRs, the start and end coordinates define the clusters of spatially proximal bases with the probability threshold (*t*) equal to 1 and epsilon-neighborhood ($\epsilon$) equal to 10000. For PTBPs, the start and end (start+1) coordinates define the most biologically meaningful boundary point within each PTBR.
