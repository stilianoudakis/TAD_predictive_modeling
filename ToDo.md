- implement jaccard index as performance metric


+ make sure what kb resolution Mourad model uses; where/how was it obtained
- read "A few useful things to know about machine learning" Pedro Domingos
+ discuss "feature engineering" 
+ Make tables/figures for all the current results, describe them in manuscript
+ Add formatted references in manuscript
- look at distributions of overlap counts and percents predictors
+ understand how variable importance is calculated for any and all algorithms
- look at correlations amoung predictors for each type


Backburner: 
- use tfbs encode clustered in separate model (/home/sequencing/data/ExtData/db_5.00_07-22-2015/grsnp_db/hg19/ENCODE/). Goal - to compare the results with Hong et. al 2017 paper, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx738
- look at chromosome specific models and compare
- revisit comparing results with mourad (take his finding and compare; in discussion discuss differences)
- Apply model to other cell lines cell line
- GBM
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- neural network
- MLR
- Elastic-Net
