- perform models without variable reduction and compare
- investigate whether or not variable reduction should occur before or after balancing 
- use tfbs encode clustered in separate model (/home/sequencing/data/ExtData/db_5.00_07-22-2015/grsnp_db/hg19/ENCODE/)
- revisit comparing results with mourad
- Apply ensemble to other cell lines cell line
- GBM
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- neural network
- MLR
- Elastic-Net (if decide not to use variable reduction)
- look at chromosome specific models and compare
- find out how to obtain consensus tree from random forest
- look at distributions of overlap counts and percents predictors
- understand how variable importance is calculated for any and all algorithms
- look at correlations amoung predictors for each type
