- copy manuscript template
- Read papers!
- look into straw tool to get resolutions from different cell lines
- implement jaccard index as performance metric
- transform other predictor types
- add discussion; discuss literature: previous results, recommendations
- fix figure 10; make 4 panels specifying resolution
- make figure 10 into a table
- fix link for gerp 
- look at models with all predictor types 
- look at distributions of overlap counts and percents predictors
- look at correlations amoung predictors for each type


Backburner: 
- use tfbs encode clustered in separate model (/home/sequencing/data/ExtData/db_5.00_07-22-2015/grsnp_db/hg19/ENCODE/). Goal - to compare the results with Hong et. al 2017 paper, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx738
- look at chromosome specific models and compare
- revisit comparing results with mourad (take his finding and compare; in discussion discuss differences)
- Apply model to other cell lines in order to identify shared and unique features
- Combine TAD boundaries from all cell lines and predict them using features common to all cell lines to estimate performance and identify universal set of features
- GBM
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- neural network
- MLR
- Elastic-Net 
- Understand the paper and Figure 5C (justification of the number of features kept in the model) from https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3539 - can (should) we generate similar?
- Understand Figure 6 and 7 from https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3539 - predictive importance of features, will be OC, OP, and distance in our case
