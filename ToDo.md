- look into straw tool to get resolutions from different cell lines
- implement jaccard index as performance metric
- remove figures/tables from manuscript.rmd
- fix figure 4
- fix figure 11, label each region; extend legend
- transform other predictor types
- add discussion; discuss literature: previous results, recommendations
- fix figure 10; make 4 panels specifying resolution
- make figure 10 into a table
- fix link for gerp 
+ remove ucne; vmr
- add multiple elemental versions (i.e. _14/_15) to table 1
- keep underscores in element name in table 1
+ remove "combined" features
- provide real url for histones and dnase features in table 1
- look at models with all predictor types 


- read "A few useful things to know about machine learning" Pedro Domingos
- look at distributions of overlap counts and percents predictors
- look at correlations amoung predictors for each type


Backburner: 
- use tfbs encode clustered in separate model (/home/sequencing/data/ExtData/db_5.00_07-22-2015/grsnp_db/hg19/ENCODE/). Goal - to compare the results with Hong et. al 2017 paper, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx738
- look at chromosome specific models and compare
- revisit comparing results with mourad (take his finding and compare; in discussion discuss differences)
- Apply model to other cell lines cell line
- GBM
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- neural network
- MLR
- Elastic-Net
