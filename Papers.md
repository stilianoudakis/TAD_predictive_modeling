PLOS Computational Biology 12, no. 5 (May 20, 2016): e1004908. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004908. - Predicting TAD boundaries from transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Multiple logistic regression with lasso L1 penalization, allows for interactions, positive/negative effect. Outperforms enrichment test, random forest (https://github.com/aloysius-lim/bigrf). For humans, CTCF, Cohesin, ZNF134, Polycomb group proteins are positive predictors, P300, RXRA, BCL11A and ELK1 are negative predictors. Tested for the effect of SNPs in CTCF binding sites (SNPs destroy TAD boundaries), the effect of slightly imprecise boundaries. Hi-C bins are assigned 1/0 for overlapping/nonoverlapping TFBSs, or % overlap if it is partial. No mentioning class disbalance problem, no cross-validation, no explicit distance consideration, no histone marks. HiCfeat R package, https://sites.google.com/site/raphaelmouradeng/home/programs

Intro about histone modifications enriched in TAD boundaries (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac). Math, statistics, assumptions, regularization. Parameters of the model should be estimated via training, Cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Hi-C data from Human IMR90, ES, mouse ES. Binning ChIP-seq and DNAse-seq data at 40kb resolution as log RPKMs, consensus TAD boundaries from Armatus. The sets of 4 and 6 modifications that were most informative are: {H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3} and {H3K4me3, H3K79me2, H3K27ac, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H4K20me1}. chromatin states from Segway are not important. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/research/ntdp/

Rank chromatin interactions into high ("hubs"), median, low, non-significant. Hubs are enriched in GWAS SNPs. Hubs are enriched in and predicted by H3K4me1, H3K27ac (markers of enhancers) in the center. Conservation, GC content, distance  to TSS did NOT improve predictions. The model trained using one cell type data predicts hubs in another. TAD boundaries from IMR90 (Dixon) vs. non-boundary genomic loci with similar interaction frequency. CTCF, then negative H3K4me1, are the most predictive, but H3K4me3 is the second most enriched.

Genes, especially, housekeeping, are enriched near TAD boundaries. High- and extreme occupancy target regions (TF binding) are also enriched. CTCF enrichment is general. Logistic regression to predict TAD boundaries from TFBSs, prioritize which TFs are most important, Refs 18 and 19 refer to similar work. https://github.com/gersteinlab/MrTADFinder

Enhancer-promoter interaction prediction from several features: enhancer-promoter activity profile correlation, TF-promoter correlation, enhancer-promoter coevolution, distance between enhancer and promoter. DISTANCE is the most important predictive feature, but helped by others. Random forest, SVM and logistic regression perform worse. Compared with four other methods (nearest promoter, PreSTIGE, Ernst, Thurman). Cross-validation, no overfitting. Enhancer-promoter interactions are more cell-type-specific than just enhancers.
